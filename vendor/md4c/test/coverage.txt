# Coverage

This file is just a collection of unit tests not covered elsewhere.

Most notably regression tests, tests improving code coverage and other useful
things may drop here.

(However any tests requiring any additional command line option, like enabling
an extension, must be included in their respective files.)

````````````````````````````````


## Code coverage

### `md_is_unicode_whitespace__()`

Unicode whitespace (here U+2000) forms a word boundary so these cannot be
resolved as emphasis span because there is no closer mark.

```````````````````````````````` example
*foo *bar
.
<p>*foo *bar</p>
````````````````````````````````


### `md_is_unicode_punct__()`

Ditto for Unicode punctuation (here U+00A1).

```````````````````````````````` example
*foo¡*bar
.
<p>*foo¡*bar</p>
````````````````````````````````


### `md_get_unicode_fold_info()`

```````````````````````````````` example
[Příliš žluťoučký kůň úpěl ďábelské ódy.]

[PŘÍLIŠ ŽLUŤOUČKÝ KŮŇ ÚPĚL ĎÁBELSKÉ ÓDY.]: /url
.
<p><a href="/url">Příliš žluťoučký kůň úpěl ďábelské ódy.</a></p>
````````````````````````````````


### `md_decode_utf8__()` and `md_decode_utf8_before__()`

```````````````````````````````` example
á*Á (U+00E1, i.e. two byte UTF-8 sequence)
 *  (U+2000, i.e. three byte UTF-8 sequence)
.
<p>á*Á (U+00E1, i.e. two byte UTF-8 sequence)
 *  (U+2000, i.e. three byte UTF-8 sequence)</p>
````````````````````````````````


### `md_is_link_destination_A()`

```````````````````````````````` example
[link](</url\.with\.escape>)
.
<p><a href="/url.with.escape">link</a></p>
````````````````````````````````


### `md_link_label_eq()`

```````````````````````````````` example
[foo bar]

[foo bar]: /url
.
<p><a href="/url">foo bar</a></p>
````````````````````````````````


### `md_is_inline_link_spec()`

```````````````````````````````` example
> [link](/url 'foo
> bar')
.
<blockquote>
<p><a href="/url" title="foo
bar">link</a></p>
</blockquote>
````````````````````````````````


### `md_build_ref_def_hashtable()`

All link labels in the following example all have the same FNV1a hash (after
normalization of the label, which means after converting to a vector of Unicode
codepoints and lowercase folding).

So the example triggers quite complex code paths which are not otherwise easily
tested.

```````````````````````````````` example
[foo]: /foo
[qnptgbh]: /qnptgbh
[abgbrwcv]: /abgbrwcv
[abgbrwcv]: /abgbrwcv2
[abgbrwcv]: /abgbrwcv3
[abgbrwcv]: /abgbrwcv4
[alqadfgn]: /alqadfgn

[foo]
[qnptgbh]
[abgbrwcv]
[alqadfgn]
[axgydtdu]
.
<p><a href="/foo">foo</a>
<a href="/qnptgbh">qnptgbh</a>
<a href="/abgbrwcv">abgbrwcv</a>
<a href="/alqadfgn">alqadfgn</a>
[axgydtdu]</p>
````````````````````````````````

For the sake of completeness, the following C program was used to find the hash
collisions by brute force:

~~~

#include <stdio.h>
#include <string.h>


static unsigned etalon;



#define MD_FNV1A_BASE       2166136261
#define MD_FNV1A_PRIME      16777619

static inline unsigned
fnv1a(unsigned base, const void* data, size_t n)
{
    const unsigned char* buf = (const unsigned char*) data;
    unsigned hash = base;
    size_t i;

    for(i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        hash ^= buf[i];
        hash *= MD_FNV1A_PRIME;
    }

    return hash;
}


static unsigned
unicode_hash(const char* data, size_t n)
{
    unsigned value;
    unsigned hash = MD_FNV1A_BASE;
    int i;

    for(i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        value = data[i];
        hash = fnv1a(hash, &value, sizeof(unsigned));
    }

    return hash;
}


static void
recurse(char* buffer, size_t off, size_t len)
{
    int ch;

    if(off < len - 1) {
        for(ch = 'a'; ch <= 'z'; ch++) {
            buffer[off] = ch;
            recurse(buffer, off+1, len);
        }
    } else {
        for(ch = 'a'; ch <= 'z'; ch++) {
            buffer[off] = ch;
            if(unicode_hash(buffer, len) == etalon) {
                printf("Dup: %.*s\n", (int)len, buffer);
            }
        }
    }
}

int
main(int argc, char** argv)
{
    char buffer[32];
    int len;

    if(argc < 2)
        etalon = unicode_hash("foo", 3);
    else
        etalon = unicode_hash(argv[1], strlen(argv[1]));

    for(len = 1; len <= sizeof(buffer); len++)
        recurse(buffer, 0, len);

    return 0;
}
