<p>quick-lint-js has two packages in the AUR:</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <a href="https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/quick-lint-js/">quick-lint-js</a
    >: latest stable release
  </li>
  <li>
    <a href="https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/quick-lint-js-git/"
      >quick-lint-js-git</a
    >: unstable version from VCS
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
  If you are using an
  <a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/AUR_helpers">AUR helper</a>, install
  quick-lint-js on Arch Linux using your helper. For example, to install with
  <a href="https://github.com/Jguer/yay">yay</a>, open a terminal and run the
  following commands:
</p>
<blockquote>
  <pre><code class="shell-session"><kbd>yay -Sy quick-lint-js</kbd></code></pre>
</blockquote>

<p>
  If you want to install without an AUR helper, download and install the package
  from AUR manually by running the following commands:
</p>
<blockquote>
  <pre><code class="shell-session"><kbd>pacman -Sy base-devel git</kbd>
<kbd>git clone https://aur.archlinux.org/quick-lint-js.git aur-quick-lint-js</kbd>
<kbd>cd aur-quick-lint-js</kbd>
<kbd>makepkg -si</kbd></code></pre>
</blockquote>
