        <h3>Introduction</h3>
        <p>
          I was watching a programming Twitch stream when I noticed the coder
          make a mistake. I quickly pointed them to the
          <a href="../../">quick-lint-js</a> VS Code extension which I knew
          would highlight their mistake. My heart sank when
          <a

          This post chronicles the journey in finding, root-causing, and fixing
          this bug.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section id="reproducing">
        <h3>Reproducing the bug</h3>
        <p>
          The first step I took is to make the bug happen on my computer. I
          started by doing exactly what the streamer did: introduce a mistake in
          a JavaScript file, install the production version of quick-lint-js
          using the VS Code Marketplace, then close the extension tab. Of
          course, the bug didn't happen when I tried.
        </p>

        <p>I tried a few more times, in case the bug was spurious. No luck.</p>

        <p>
          Then I decided to upgrade VS Code. No
          <abbr title="reproduction">repro</abbr>.
        </p>

        <p>Then I tried on Windows instead of Linux. No repro.</p>

        <p>
          While streaming my repro attempts on
          <a href="https://twitch.tv/strager">my Twitch stream</a>, one viewer,
          HPWebcamAble, said he encountered the problem too and could reproduce
          it. Nice! He
          <a
            href="https://github.com/quick-lint/quick-lint-js/issues/718#issuecomment-1132432091"
            >posted a video of the bug</a
          >. He was able to reproduce it by reloading VS Code. Unfortunately, I
          tried on my machine to no avail.

        <p>
          Hypothesis: The bug was a race condition, and a fast machine (like
          mine) didn't trigger the race condition.
        </p>

        <p>
          I built an unoptimized version of the extension, hoping it would slow
          things down enough to trigger the race condition. The extension didn't
          work at all; it didn't even load. Oops, I forgot I had installed the
          32-bit (x86) version of VS Code for testing, and I was building the
          64-bit (x64) version of the extension.
        </p>

        <p>
          I switched to the x64 version of VS Code and installed quick-lint-js
          from the VS Code Marketplace. The buggy squiggly appeared! I
          successfully reproduced the bug.
        </p>

        <p>Hypothesis: The bug was specific to Windows x64 builds.</p>

      <section id="isolating">
        <h3>Isolating the bug</h3>
        <p>
          To investigate further, I needed to build the extension from source.
          When I tried, the bug didn't happen. Hmm.
        </p>

        <p>
          The quick-lint-js VS Code extension is written in C++. You can build
          it with different C++ compilers:
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            I originally tried a Debug build using MSVC (from Visual Studio
            2022), but the bug didn't reproduce.
          </li>
          <li>
            Then I tried a Debug build using Clang (LLVM-MinGW), and the bug
            still didn't reproduce.
          </li>
          <li>
            Then I tried a Release build with GCC (MinGW), and I successfully
            reproduced the bug.
          </li>
        </ol>

        <p>
          Now that I could change the code, my first instinct was to 🪵 add 🪵
          logging 🪵 everywhere. I started by logging the line and character
          numbers calculated by the core quick-lint-js engine. Everything looked
          good.
        </p>

        <p>
          Then I logged the
          <code class="javascript type">Diagnostic</code> objects given to VS
          Code. There was an obvious problem: the line and column numbers for
          the first diagnostic were not integral:
        </p>

          <img

          />
          <figcaption>
            console.log of the
            <code class="javascript type">Diagnostic</code> object
          </figcaption>
        </figure>

        <p>
          What the heck is
          <code class="javascript literal">1.2030528096229781e-307</code> and
          where is it coming from??
        </p>

        <p>
          I tried hard-coding <code class="javascript literal">42</code> as the
          line number. The
          <code class="javascript type">Diagnostic</code> object still had the
          strange number.
        </p>

        <p>
          I tried logging the number before I stored it in the
          <code class="javascript type">Diagnostic</code> object. The log showed
          the broken number, but the bug disappeared. When I added this extra
          logging, I created a second JavaScript number object. I changed the
          logging code to use the same number object as was given to the
          <code class="javascript type">Diagnostic</code> object, and the bug
          reappeared.
        </p>

        <p>
          To create numbers in the JavaScript VM, the quick-lint-js C++ code
          uses
          <a
            href="https://nodejs.org/dist/latest-v16.x/docs/api/n-api.html"
            title="Node.js API"
            ><dfn id="napi-definition">N-API</dfn> (aka Node-API)</a
          >. (VS Code extensions are written for Node.js.) The function I was
          calling was <code class="cxx function">napi_create_double</code> which
          creates a JavaScript number object from a C++
          <code class="cxx type">double</code>. Maybe
          <code class="cxx function">napi_create_double</code> was failing? I
          double-checked the error code. <code class="cxx">napi_ok</code>.
        </p>

        <p>
          I was calling <code class="cxx function">napi_create_double</code>,
          but my number is always an integer. (Fractional line numbers don't
          make sense in VS Code.) I tried
          <code class="cxx function">napi_create_int32</code>, and it worked
          perfectly. Something was wrong with
          <code class="cxx function">napi_create_double</code> specifically.
        </p>

        <p>
          Hypothesis: The compiler is generating incorrect code for the call to
          <code class="cxx function">napi_create_double</code>. Perhaps GCC
          wasn't adhering to the Windows x64 calling convention when calling
          N-API functions. I checked Microsoft's documentation on
          <a
            href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/build/x64-calling-convention?view=msvc-170"
            >Windows x64 ABI</a
          >
          and checked the assembly code generated by GCC when calling
          <code class="cxx function">napi_create_double</code>. GCC was doing
          the right thing by storing the number in the
          <code class="x86">xmm1</code> register.
        </p>

        <p>
          Hypothesis: Some earlier code corrupted N-API somehow. I moved my test
          code into the extension initialization. The logged number was still
          corrupted, but the bug disappeared.
        </p>

        <p>
          Hypothesis: The bug happened only for the very first number I create.
          I ran my test code in a loop and confirmed that only the first number
          is broken. This is why creating a number during initialization (for
          testing) made the bug disappear.
        </p>

        <p>
          I now know that the first call to
          <code class="cxx function">napi_create_double</code> creates a broken
          JavaScript number. What is
          <code class="cxx function">napi_create_double</code> doing?
        </p>

        <p>
          I looked at the
          <a
            href="https://github.com/nodejs/node/blob/v18.2.0/src/js_native_api_v8.cc#L1515-L1525"
            >C++ code for
            <code class="cxx function">napi_create_double</code></a
          >
          in Node.js. Nothing looked suspicious. I also looked at the Git
          history. The function hasn't changed since it was introduced.
        </p>

        <p>
          On Windows, an <dfn>implib</dfn> is the glue code between DLLs. In my
          case, a Node.js implib allowed the quick-lint-js extension DLL to call
          <a href="#napi-definition">N-API functions</a> in VS Code.
        </p>

        <p>
          I took a peek at the implib code for
          <code class="cxx function">napi_create_double</code>. Nothing looked
          suspicious, but it was calling
          <code class="cxx function">__delayLoadHelper2</code>. I looked at
          <a
            href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/build/reference/understanding-the-helper-function?view=msvc-170"
            >its documentation</a
          >
          and found no errata about
          <code class="cxx type">double</code> arguments. (But that's no
          guarantee that the function is bug-free!)

          When does my number get corrupted? I attached a C++ debugger (<a
            href="https://www.sourceware.org/gdb/"
            title="The GNU Project Debugger"
            >gdb</a
          >) to VS Code. I set a breakpoint on the extension's initialization
          and I stepped through the code. Inside
          <code class="cxx function">napi_create_double</code> in the implib,
          the <code class="x86">xmm1</code> register contained
          <code class="x86 literal">42.0</code> as expected. I kept stepping
          through and didn't see any changes to <code class="x86">xmm1</code>.
        </p>

        <p>
          Stepping through each and every assembly instruction to detect a
          change to a register is tedious. I decided to try a new feature of
          gdb: register watchpoints. I ran
          <code class="gdb">watch xmm1 -thread 1</code>, and immediately got an
          answer: a function in NTDLL (part of Windows) was modifying
          <code class="x86">xmm1</code>! Hey, that number looks familiar!

            >Windows x64 ABI</a
          >. <code class="x86">xmm1</code> is a <em>volatile</em> register that
          is supposed to be saved by the caller. I looked at the
          <a href="#implib-code">implib code</a>, and sure enough,
          <code class="x86">xmm1</code> wasn't being saved. I think I found the
          root cause!

        <h3>Fixing the bug</h3>
        <p>
          My current hypothesis: The implib code should have saved
          <code class="x86">xmm1</code>, but it didn't.
        </p>

        <p>
          I needed to change the implib code. The code is generated by
          <dfn>dlltool</dfn>
          which is part of
          <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/binutils/">GNU binutils</a>. So
          let's build binutils from source.
        </p>

        <p>What a pain.</p>

        <p>
          Because I previously installed binutils using MSYS, I decided to use
          their options to build binutils from source. I cloned the binutils-gdb
          Git repository, then I copy-pasted some commands from MSYS'
          <a
            href="https://github.com/msys2/MINGW-packages/blob/8fa1309831e20a83cc87812a940c303bbf730066/mingw-w64-binutils/PKGBUILD"
            >PKGBUILD file</a
          >, filling in some variables with educated guesses. (I guessed wrong a
          few times, of course.) Builds were slow because half my CPU was
          dedicated to streaming on Twitch.
        </p>

        <p>
          Eventually, I got everything but gdb compiling. (I didn't want to
          build gdb, but I couldn't figure out how to build only dlltool.)
          However, I realized that "everything" isn't everything. dlltool didn't
          get built. Huh?
        </p>

        <p>
          It turns out I broke something along the way and needed to
          clean-build. Yay Autotools! After a clean build, everything was built,
          including dlltool (but not gdb for some reason).
        </p>

        <p>
          I told the quick-lint-js build system to use my newly-built dlltool,
          then fired off a build. dlltool gave me a cryptic message:
        </p>
        <figure>
          <pre
            class="emphasized"

        </figure>

        <p>
          <code class="cxx function">CreateProcess</code> is a Windows API for
          running .exe files. I pulled out
          <a
            href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/downloads/procmon"
            >Procmon</a
          >
          to see which <code class="cxx function">CreateProcess</code> call was
          failing. dlltool was trying to run <code>as</code> (GAS, the GNU
          Assembler), but couldn't find it.
        </p>

        <p>
          In a normal installation of binutils, all the tools are in the same
          directory. However, in my development build,
          <code>dlltool.exe</code> and <code>as.exe</code> were in different
          directories.
        </p>

        <p>
          I decided to run the binutils installation script, installing
          everything into temporary directory called <code>stragerusr</code>:

        <p>
          After a minute, I realized that binutils was being installed in
          <code>/ucrt64</code>, not into my temporary directory. Oh no!
        </p>

        <p>
          I canceled the install script and tried recompiling quick-lint-js.
          Everything was broken. To clean up the mess I made, I reinstalled
          everything using MSYS:

        </figure>

        <p>
          Back to fixing the <code>CreateProcess</code> error. I copied
          <code>/ucrt64/bin/as.exe</code> into my build directory containing
          <code>dlltool.exe</code>. Then dlltool worked fine.
        </p>

        <p>
          I built the quick-lint-js VS Code extension and ran it. VS Code
          crashed! Hmm.
        </p>

        <p>
          I looked at the implib generated by the new dlltool. The assembly was
          different. I used a newer version of binutils than I was using
          previously. The newest version has a patch to support Structured
          Exception Handling (SEH). I reverted that patch, re-built the
          extension, and VS Code no longer crashed. Of course, the
          <code class="cxx function">napi_create_double</code> bug persisted.
        </p>

        <p>
          I took a break. The next day, I tried dlltool with the SEH patch and
          it didn't crash. Huh. Maybe I screwed something up the previous day.
          🤷‍♀️
        </p>

        <p>
          I hacked dlltool to save <code class="x86">xmm1</code>. I made a few
          mistakes along the way:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>wrong assembly instruction to store to memory</li>
          <li>used an aligned store on unaligned addresses</li>
          <li>restored the stack pointer incorrectly</li>
          <li>
            modified the x86 (32-bit) code instead of the x64 (64-bit) code
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          Eventually, my dlltool patch fixed the
          <code class="cxx function">napi_create_double</code> bug! I reverted
          all my debugging changes to the quick-lint-js extension and tried
          again. The original bug was gone. Hurray!

          Now that I had a proven fix in dlltool, there's a problem: How can I
          make quick-lint-js' CI builds use the patched dlltool? I want to avoid
          custom toolchains for this open-source project.

          However, this workaround only applies to quick-lint-js. What about

          I've hit compiler bugs before, but this bug was the hardest I've
          squashed. Investigating and fixing it took a few days and spanned
          several codebases.
