<h4>Using Creative Commons Public Licenses</h4>

<p>
  Creative Commons public licenses provide a standard set of terms and
  conditions that creators and other rights holders may use to share original
  works of authorship and other material subject to copyright and certain other
  rights specified in the public license below. The following considerations are
  for informational purposes only, are not exhaustive, and do not form part of
  our licenses.
</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>
    Considerations for licensors: Our public licenses are intended for use by
    those authorized to give the public permission to use material in ways
    otherwise restricted by copyright and certain other rights. Our licenses are
    irrevocable. Licensors should read and understand the terms and conditions
    of the license they choose before applying it. Licensors should also secure
    all rights necessary before applying our licenses so that the public can
    reuse the material as expected. Licensors should clearly mark any material
    not subject to the license. This includes other CC- licensed material, or
    material used under an exception or limitation to copyright. More
    considerations for licensors:

  </p>

  <p>
    Considerations for the public: By using one of our public licenses, a
    licensor grants the public permission to use the licensed material under
    specified terms and conditions. If the licensor's permission is not
    necessary for any reason--for example, because of any applicable exception
    or limitation to copyright--then that use is not regulated by the license.
    Our licenses grant only permissions under copyright and certain other rights
    that a licensor has authority to grant. Use of the licensed material may
    still be restricted for other reasons, including because others have
    copyright or other rights in the material. A licensor may make special
    requests, such as asking that all changes be marked or described. Although
    not required by our licenses, you are encouraged to respect those requests
    where reasonable. More_considerations for the public:

<h5>Section 2 -- Scope.</h5>

<ol type="a">
  <li>
    License grant.
    <ol type="1">
      <li>
        Subject to the terms and conditions of this Public License, the Licensor
        hereby grants You a worldwide, royalty-free, non-sublicensable,
        non-exclusive, irrevocable license to exercise the Licensed Rights in
        the Licensed Material to:
        <ol type="a">
          <li>
            reproduce and Share the Licensed Material, in whole or in part; and
          </li>

          <li>produce, reproduce, and Share Adapted Material.</li>
        </ol>
      </li>

      <li>
        Exceptions and Limitations. For the avoidance of doubt, where Exceptions
        and Limitations apply to Your use, this Public License does not apply,
        and You do not need to comply with its terms and conditions.
      </li>

      <li>
        Term. The term of this Public License is specified in Section 6(a).
      </li>

      <li>
        Media and formats; technical modifications allowed. The Licensor
        authorizes You to exercise the Licensed Rights in all media and formats
        whether now known or hereafter created, and to make technical
        modifications necessary to do so. The Licensor waives and/or agrees not
        to assert any right or authority to forbid You from making technical
        modifications necessary to exercise the Licensed Rights, including
        technical modifications necessary to circumvent Effective Technological
        Measures. For purposes of this Public License, simply making
        modifications authorized by this Section 2(a) (4) never produces Adapted
        Material.
      </li>

      <li>
        Downstream recipients.
        <ol type="a">
          <li>
            Offer from the Licensor -- Licensed Material. Every recipient of the
            Licensed Material automatically receives an offer from the Licensor
            to exercise the Licensed Rights under the terms and conditions of
            this Public License.
          </li>

          <li>
            Additional offer from the Licensor -- Adapted Material. Every
            recipient of Adapted Material from You automatically receives an
            offer from the Licensor to exercise the Licensed Rights in the
            Adapted Material under the conditions of the Adapter's License You
            apply.
          </li>

          <li>
            No downstream restrictions. You may not offer or impose any
            additional or different terms or conditions on, or apply any
            Effective Technological Measures to, the Licensed Material if doing
            so restricts exercise of the Licensed Rights by any recipient of the
            Licensed Material.
          </li>
        </ol>
      </li>

      <li>
        No endorsement. Nothing in this Public License constitutes or may be
        construed as permission to assert or imply that You are, or that Your
        use of the Licensed Material is, connected with, or sponsored, endorsed,
        or granted official status by, the Licensor or others designated to
        receive attribution as provided in Section 3(a)(1)(A)(i).
      </li>
    </ol>
  </li>

  <li>
    Other rights.
    <ol type="1">
      <li>
        Moral rights, such as the right of integrity, are not licensed under
        this Public License, nor are publicity, privacy, and/or other similar
        personality rights; however, to the extent possible, the Licensor waives
        and/or agrees not to assert any such rights held by the Licensor to the
        limited extent necessary to allow You to exercise the Licensed Rights,
        but not otherwise.
      </li>

      <li>
        Patent and trademark rights are not licensed under this Public License.
      </li>

      <li>
        To the extent possible, the Licensor waives any right to collect
        royalties from You for the exercise of the Licensed Rights, whether
        directly or through a collecting society under any voluntary or waivable
        statutory or compulsory licensing scheme. In all other cases the
        Licensor expressly reserves any right to collect such royalties.
      </li>

      </li>

      <li>
        You may satisfy the conditions in Section 3(a)(1) in any reasonable

        the required information.

        If requested by the Licensor, You must remove any of the information

      In addition to the conditions in Section 3(a), if You Share Adapted
      Material You produce, the following conditions also apply.
    </p>

    <ol type="1">
      <li>
        The Adapter's License You apply must be a Creative Commons license with

<h5>Section 4 -- Sui Generis Database Rights.</h5>

<p>
  Where the Licensed Rights include Sui Generis Database Rights that apply to
  Your use of the Licensed Material:
</p>

<ol type="a">
  <li>
    for the avoidance of doubt, Section 2(a)(1) grants You the right to extract,
    reuse, reproduce, and Share all or a substantial portion of the contents of
    the database;
  </li>

  <li>
    if You include all or a substantial portion of the database contents in a
    database in which You have Sui Generis Database Rights, then the database in
    which You have Sui Generis Database Rights (but not its individual contents)
    is Adapted Material, including for purposes of Section 3(b); and
  </li>

  <li>
    You must comply with the conditions in Section 3(a) if You Share all or a
    substantial portion of the contents of the database.

  other Copyright and Similar Rights.
</p>

<h5>Section 5 -- Disclaimer of Warranties and Limitation of Liability.</h5>

<ol type="a">
  <li>
    UNLESS OTHERWISE SEPARATELY UNDERTAKEN BY THE LICENSOR, TO THE EXTENT
    POSSIBLE, THE LICENSOR OFFERS THE LICENSED MATERIAL AS-IS AND AS-AVAILABLE,
    AND MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND CONCERNING THE
    LICENSED MATERIAL, WHETHER EXPRESS, IMPLIED, STATUTORY, OR OTHER. THIS
    INCLUDES, WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES OF TITLE, MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS
    FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, ABSENCE OF LATENT OR OTHER
    DEFECTS, ACCURACY, OR THE PRESENCE OR ABSENCE OF ERRORS, WHETHER OR NOT
    KNOWN OR DISCOVERABLE. WHERE DISCLAIMERS OF WARRANTIES ARE NOT ALLOWED IN
    FULL OR IN PART, THIS DISCLAIMER MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.
  </li>

  <li>
    TO THE EXTENT POSSIBLE, IN NO EVENT WILL THE LICENSOR BE LIABLE TO YOU ON

    FOR ANY DIRECT, SPECIAL, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE,
    EXEMPLARY, OR OTHER LOSSES, COSTS, EXPENSES, OR DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THIS
    PUBLIC LICENSE OR USE OF THE LICENSED MATERIAL, EVEN IF THE LICENSOR HAS
    BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH LOSSES, COSTS, EXPENSES, OR DAMAGES.
    WHERE A LIMITATION OF LIABILITY IS NOT ALLOWED IN FULL OR IN PART, THIS
    LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.
  </li>

  <li>
    The disclaimer of warranties and limitation of liability provided above

    approximates an absolute disclaimer and waiver of all liability.

<h5>Section 6 -- Term and Termination.</h5>

<ol type="a">
  <li>
    This Public License applies for the term of the Copyright and Similar Rights

      <li>upon express reinstatement by the Licensor.</li>
    </ol>

    <p>
      For the avoidance of doubt, this Section 6(b) does not affect any right
      the Licensor may have to seek remedies for Your violations of this Public
      License.
    </p>
  </li>

  <li>
    For the avoidance of doubt, the Licensor may also offer the Licensed
    Material under separate terms or conditions or stop distributing the
    Licensed Material at any time; however, doing so will not terminate this
    Public License.
  </li>

  <li>
    Sections 1, 5, 6, 7, and 8 survive termination of this Public License.
  </li>
</ol>

<h5>Section 7 -- Other Terms and Conditions.</h5>

<ol type="a">
  <li>
    For the avoidance of doubt, this Public License does not, and shall not be

    the Licensed Material that could lawfully be made without permission under
    this Public License.
  </li>

  <li>
    To the extent possible, if any provision of this Public License is deemed
    unenforceable, it shall be automatically reformed to the minimum extent
    necessary to make it enforceable. If the provision cannot be reformed, it
    shall be severed from this Public License without affecting the
    enforceability of the remaining terms and conditions.
  </li>

  <li>
    No term or condition of this Public License will be waived and no failure to
    comply consented to unless expressly agreed to by the Licensor.
  </li>

  <li>
    Nothing in this Public License constitutes or may be interpreted as a
    limitation upon, or waiver of, any privileges and immunities that apply to
    the Licensor or You, including from the legal processes of any jurisdiction
    or authority.
