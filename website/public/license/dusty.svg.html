    <strong>License grant</strong>.
    <ol>
      <li>
        Subject to the terms and conditions of this Public License, the Licensor
        hereby grants You a worldwide, royalty-free, non-sublicensable,
        non-exclusive, irrevocable license to exercise the Licensed Rights in
        the Licensed Material to:
        <ol type="A">
          <li>
            reproduce and Share the Licensed Material, in whole or in part; and
          </li>
          <li>produce and reproduce, but not Share, Adapted Material.</li>

      <li>
        <span style="text-decoration: underline"
          >Exceptions and Limitations</span
        >. For the avoidance of doubt, where Exceptions and Limitations apply to
        Your use, this Public License does not apply, and You do not need to
        comply with its terms and conditions.
      </li>
      <li>
        <span style="text-decoration: underline">Term</span>. The term of this
        Public License is specified in Section 6(a).

      <li>
        <span style="text-decoration: underline"
          >Media and formats; technical modifications allowed</span
        >. The Licensor authorizes You to exercise the Licensed Rights in all
        media and formats whether now known or hereafter created, and to make
        technical modifications necessary to do so. The Licensor waives and/or
        agrees not to assert any right or authority to forbid You from making
        technical modifications necessary to exercise the Licensed Rights,
        including technical modifications necessary to circumvent Effective
        Technological Measures. For purposes of this Public License, simply
        making modifications authorized by this Section 2(a)(4) never produces
        Adapted Material.

        personality rights; however, to the extent possible, the Licensor waives
        and/or agrees not to assert any such rights held by the Licensor to the
        limited extent necessary to allow You to exercise the Licensed Rights,

        Patent and trademark rights are not licensed under this Public License.
      </li>
      <li>
        To the extent possible, the Licensor waives any right to collect
        royalties from You for the exercise of the Licensed Rights, whether
        directly or through a collecting society under any voluntary or waivable
        statutory or compulsory licensing scheme. In all other cases the

        You may satisfy the conditions in Section 3(a)(1) in any reasonable
        manner based on the medium, means, and context in which You Share the

  <li>
    if You include all or a substantial portion of the database contents in a

  <li>
    You must comply with the conditions in Section 3(a) if You Share all or a

<p><strong>Section 6 – Term and Termination.</strong></p>
