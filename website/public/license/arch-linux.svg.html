<h3>Trademark Policy</h3>
<p>
  The objective of the Arch Linux trademark policy is to encourage widespread
  use of the Arch Linux trademarks by the Arch Linux community while controlling
  that use in order to avoid confusion on the part of Arch Linux users and the
  general public, to maintain the value of the image and reputation of the
  trademarks and to protect them from inappropriate or unauthorised use.
</p>

<p>
  The sections below describe what is allowed, what is not allowed, and cases in
  which you should ask permission. If you have any doubt, please contact us at
  <a href="mailto:trademarks@archlinux.org">trademarks@archlinux.org</a>.
</p>

<h4>The Trademarks</h4>
<p>
  Aaron Griffin (hereinafter the "Arch Linux Project Lead") and Judd Vinet, on
  behalf of Arch Linux, own a number of trademarks including "ARCHLINUX", "ARCH
  LINUX", "A simple, lightweight Linux distribution" and the stylized Arch Linux
  logo. The trademarks are recognized in both word and logo form. Any mark
  beginning with the letters ARCH is sufficiently similar to one or more of the
  trademarks that permission will be needed in order to use it. This policy
  encompasses all marks, in word and logo form (collectively referred to as
  "Trademarks").
</p>

<h4>Permitted Use</h4>
<p>
  Certain usages of the Trademarks are fine and no specific permission from us
  is needed.
</p>

<p>
  <strong>Advocacy.</strong> Arch Linux is built by, and largely for, its
  community. We share access to the Trademarks with the entire community for the
  purposes of discussion, development and advocacy. We recognise that most of
  the open source discussion and development areas are for non-commercial
  purposes and will allow the use of the Trademarks in this context, provided:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    the Trademark is used in a manner consistent with the Usage Guidelines below
  </li>
  <li>there is no commercial intent behind the use</li>
  <li>
    what you are referring to is in fact Arch Linux. If someone is confused into
    thinking that what is not Arch Linux is in fact Arch Linux, you are probably
    doing something wrong.
  </li>
  <li>
    there is no suggestion (through words or appearance) that your project is
    approved, sponsored, or affiliated with Arch Linux or its related projects
    unless it has been approved by and is accountable to the Arch Linux Project
    Lead
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
  <strong>Derived works.</strong> The ability to customise Arch Linux to meet
  your specific needs is one of the great strengths of free software in general,
  and Arch Linux in particular. While we encourage customisation and derivation
  of Arch Linux, we must balance that freedom with the integrity of the
  Trademarks and the quality which they represent. To help reach that balance,
  we have established the following guidelines and definitions.
</p>

<p>
  We recognise and encourage the concept of a "<strong>remix.</strong>" Remixes
  are derived versions of Arch Linux, and it is intended that any software and
  hardware certifications will apply to a Remix. Therefore the changes from
  official Arch Linux products must be minimal to be permitted to use the
  Trademarks. These changes can include configuration changes through the
  existing Arch Linux configuration management tools, changes to artwork and
  graphical themes and some variance in package selection. In general, a Remix
  can have applications from the Arch Linux archives added, or default
  applications removed, but removing or changing any infrastructure components
  (e.g., shared libraries or desktop components) will result in changes too
  large for the resulting product to be called by a Trademark. Note that if the
  nature of the product's divergence from Arch Linux changes, the Remix naming
  and Trademark use may no longer apply.
</p>

<p>
  Therefore, if you are creating a derivative of Arch Linux, you may use the
  Trademarks in association with the software product provided:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>the changes are minimal and unsubstantial, as described above</li>
  <li>there is no commercial intent associated with the new product</li>
  <li>
    the Trademark is used in a way that makes it clear that your project is a
    development effort related to the Arch Linux source, but that the software
    you are working upon is not in fact Arch Linux as distributed by the Arch
    Linux project
  </li>
  <li>
    there is no suggestion (through words or appearance) that your project is
    approved, sponsored, or affiliated with Arch Linux or its related projects
    unless it has been approved by and is governed by the Arch Linux Project
    Lead.
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
  If you are producing a new product which is based on Arch Linux but which has
  more substantial changes than those described above as a Remix, you are
  allowed to state (and we would encourage you to do so) that your product is
  "derived from Arch Linux", "based on Arch Linux", or "a derivative of Arch
  Linux" but you may not use the Trademarks to refer to your product. In some
  cases you may be allowed to use the Trademarks, but permission must be
  explicitly granted by the Arch Linux Project Lead. In that event, these
  products will need a trademark license, and such a license can be revoked if
  the nature of your divergence from Arch Linux changes. Products which include
  very invasive changes, such as a new kernel, the inclusion of packages which
  are not part of the Arch Linux repositories, or anything else that
  significantly impacts the technical quality or user experience would fall into
  this category are unlikely to be approved. (Note that if you are including
  packages which are not part of the Arch Linux repositories, we encourage you
  to work within the community processes, such as the Arch User Repository (AUR)
  to submit and maintain those packages within the community repositories in
  order to minimise this issue.)
</p>

<p>
  <strong>Building on Arch Linux or for Arch Linux.</strong> If you are
  producing new software which is intended for use with or on Arch Linux, you
  may use the trademark in a way which indicates the intent of your product. For
  example, if you are developing a system management tool for Arch Linux,
  acceptable project titles would be "System Management for Arch Linux" or "Arch
  Linux Based Systems Management". We would strongly discourage, and likely
  would consider to be problematic, a name such as ArchMan, Arch Management,
  ArchTools, etc. Furthermore, you may not use the Trademarks in a way which
  implies an endorsement where that does not exist, or which attempts to
  unfairly or confusingly capitalise on the goodwill or brand of the project.
</p>

<p>
  <strong>Commentary and parody.</strong> The Arch Linux Trademarks are designed
  to cover use of a mark to imply origin or endorsement by the project. When a
  user downloads something called Arch Linux, they should know it comes from the
  Arch Linux project. This helps Arch Linux build a reputation that will not be
  damaged by confusion around what is, and is not, Arch Linux. Using the
  Trademarks in your discussion, commentary, criticism or parody, in ways that
  unequivocally do not imply endorsement, is permissible. Anyone is free to
  write articles, create websites, blog about, or talk about Arch Linux -- as
  long as it's clear to everyone -- including people completely unfamiliar with
  Arch Linux -- that they are simply referring to Arch Linux and in no way
  speaking for the Arch Linux project.
</p>

<p>
  We reserve the right to review all usage within the open source community, and
  to object to any usage that appears to overstep the bounds of discussion and
  good-faith non-commercial development. In any event, once a project has left
  the open source project phase or otherwise become a commercial project, this
  policy does not authorize any use of the Trademarks in connection to that
  project.
</p>

<h4>Restricted use that requires a trademark license</h4>
<p>
  Explicit permission from the Arch Linux Project Lead is necessary to use any
  of the Trademarks under any circumstances other than those specifically
  permitted above. These include:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Any commercial use.</li>
  <li>
    Use on or in relation to a software product that includes or is built on top
    of a product supplied by us, if there is any commercial intent associated
    with that product.
  </li>
  <li>Use for merchandising purposes, e.g. on t-shirts and the like.</li>
  <li>Services relating to any of the above.</li>
</ul>

<p>
  If you wish to have permission for any of the uses above or for any other use
  which is not specifically referred to in this policy, please email
  <a href="mailto:trademarks@archlinux.org">trademarks@archlinux.org</a>
  and we will let you know as soon as possible if your proposed use is
  permissible. Permission may only be granted subject to certain conditions and
  these may include the requirement that you enter into an agreement with us to
  maintain the quality of the product and/or service which you intend to supply
  at a prescribed level.
</p>

<p>
  While there may be exceptions, it is very unlikely that we will approve
  Trademark use in the following cases:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Use of a Trademark in a company name.</li>
  <li>
    Use of a Trademark in a domain name which has a commercial intent. The
    commercial intent can range from promotion of a company or product, to
    collecting revenue generated by advertising.
  </li>
  <li>
    The calling of any software or product by the name Arch Linux (or another
    related Trademark), unless that software or product is a substantially
    unmodified Arch Linux product, or properly labelled as a "Remix" as
    described above.
  </li>
  <li>
    Use in combination with any other marks or logos. This include use of a
    Trademark in a manner that creates a "combined mark," or use that integrates
    other wording with the Trademark in a way that the public may think of the
    use as a new mark (for example Club Arch Linux or ArchBooks, or in a way
    that by use of special fonts or presentation with nearby words or images
    conveys an impression that the two are tied in some way).
  </li>
  <li>
    Use in combination with any product or service which is presented as being
    Certified or Official or formally associated with us or our products or
    services.
  </li>
  <li>
    Use in a way which implies an endorsement where that does not exist, or
    which attempts to unfairly or confusingly capitalise on the goodwill or
    brand of the project.
  </li>
  <li>
    Use of a Trademark in a manner that disparages Arch Linux and is not clearly
    third-party parody.
  </li>
  <li>
    On or in relation to a software product which constitutes a substantially
    modified version of a product supplied by the Arch Linux project, that is to
    say with material changes to the code, or services relating to such a
    product.
  </li>
  <li>
    In a title or metatag of a web page whose primary intention or result is to
    influence search engine rankings or result listings, rather than for
    discussion, development or advocacy of the Trademarks.
  </li>
</ul>

<h4>Logo Usage Guidelines</h4>

<p>
  In addition to the restrictions imposed above,
  <strong
    >the Trademark declaration (&nbsp;&trade;&nbsp;) must remain intact</strong
  >
  whenever displaying the logos.
</p>

<p>
  Our logos are presented in multiple colours and it is important that their
  visual integrity be maintained. It is therefore preferable that the logos only
  be used in their standard form but if you should feel the need to alter them
  in any way, please keep the following in mind:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Any scaling should retain the original proportions of the logo.</li>
  <li>
    A monochrome version (white, black, etc.) should be used in certain
    situations, such as when applying it to colourful or "busy" backdrops that
    would otherwise make the logo difficult to read.
  </li>
</ul>
