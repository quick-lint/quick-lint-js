  <li>
    There are no restrictions on distributing unmodified copies of Vim except
    that they must include this license text. You can also distribute unmodified
    parts of Vim, likewise unrestricted except that they must include this
    license text. You are also allowed to include executables that you made from
    the unmodified Vim sources, plus your own usage examples and Vim scripts.
  </li>

  <li>
    It is allowed to distribute a modified (or extended) version of Vim,
    including executables and/or source code, when the following four conditions
    are met:
    <ol type="1">
      <li>This license text must be included unmodified.</li>
      <li>
        The modified Vim must be distributed in one of the following five ways:
        <ol type="a">
          <li>
            If you make changes to Vim yourself, you must clearly describe in
            the distribution how to contact you. When the maintainer asks you
            (in any way) for a copy of the modified Vim you distributed, you
            must make your changes, including source code, available to the
            maintainer without fee. The maintainer reserves the right to include
            your changes in the official version of Vim. What the maintainer
            will do with your changes and under what license they will be
            distributed is negotiable. If there has been no negotiation then
            this license, or a later version, also applies to your changes. The
            current maintainer is Bram Moolenaar
            <a href="mailto:Bram@vim.org">Bram@vim.org</a>. If this changes it
            will be announced in appropriate places (most likely
            <a href="http://vim.sf.net">vim.sf.net</a>,
            <a href="https://www.vim.org">www.vim.org</a> and/or comp.editors).
            When it is completely impossible to contact the maintainer, the
            obligation to send him your changes ceases. Once the maintainer has
            confirmed that he has received your changes they will not have to be
            sent again.
          </li>

          <li>
            If you have received a modified Vim that was distributed as
            mentioned under a) you are allowed to further distribute it
            unmodified, as mentioned at I). If you make additional changes the
            text under a) applies to those changes.
          </li>

          <li>
            Provide all the changes, including source code, with every copy of
            the modified Vim you distribute. This may be done in the form of a
            context diff. You can choose what license to use for new code you
            add. The changes and their license must not restrict others from
            making their own changes to the official version of Vim.
          </li>

          <li>
            When you have a modified Vim which includes changes as mentioned
            under c), you can distribute it without the source code for the
            changes if the following three conditions are met:
            <ul>
              <li>
                The license that applies to the changes permits you to
                distribute the changes to the Vim maintainer without fee or
                restriction, and permits the Vim maintainer to include the
                changes in the official version of Vim without fee or
                restriction.
              </li>

              <li>
                You keep the changes for at least three years after last
                distributing the corresponding modified Vim. When the maintainer
                or someone who you distributed the modified Vim to asks you (in
                any way) for the changes within this period, you must make them
                available to him.
              </li>

              <li>
                You clearly describe in the distribution how to contact you.
                This contact information must remain valid for at least three
                years after last distributing the corresponding modified Vim, or
                as long as possible.
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>

          <li>
            When the GNU General Public License (GPL) applies to the changes,
            you can distribute the modified Vim under the GNU GPL version 2 or
            any later version.
          </li>
        </ol>
      </li>

      <li>
        A message must be added, at least in the output of the ":version"
        command and in the intro screen, such that the user of the modified Vim
        is able to see that it was modified. When distributing as mentioned
        under 2)e) adding the message is only required for as far as this does
        not conflict with the license used for the changes.
      </li>

      <li>
        The contact information as required under 2)a) and 2)d) must not be
        removed or changed, except that the person himself can make corrections.
      </li>
    </ol>
  </li>

  <li>
    If you distribute a modified version of Vim, you are encouraged to use the
    Vim license for your changes and make them available to the maintainer,
    including the source code. The preferred way to do this is by e-mail or by
    uploading the files to a server and e-mailing the URL. If the number of
    changes is small (e.g., a modified Makefile) e-mailing a context diff will
    do. The e-mail address to be used is
    <a href="mailto:maintainer@vim.org">maintainer@vim.org</a>
  </li>

  <li>
    It is not allowed to remove this license from the distribution of the Vim
    sources, parts of it or from a modified version. You may use this license
    for previous Vim releases instead of the license that they came with, at
    your option.
  </li>
</ol>
