      <p>
        quick-lint-js' CMake build system supports cross-compiling. You can
        build Windows executables on Linux, or ARM executables on x86.
      </p>

      <p>
        This document focuses on cross-compiling considerations specific to
        quick-lint-js. See
        <a
          href="https://cmake.org/cmake/help/book/mastering-cmake/chapter/Cross%20Compiling%20With%20CMake.html"
          >CMake's documentation on cross compiling</a
        >
        for general cross-compilation information.
      </p>

      <p>
        This document uses the term build machine and target machine. If you are
        compiling on a Linux x86_64 machine and want quick-lint-js to run on a
        Windows x86 machine, then the <dfn>build machine</dfn> is Linux x86_64,
        and the <dfn>target machine</dfn> is Windows x86.
      </p>

      <p>
        quick-lint-js has programs which run as part of the build. These
        programs must run on the build machine. When cross-compiling, you need
        to build these programs first for the build machine before building
        quick-lint-js for the target machine. To do this, configure CMake for
        the build machine and build the
        <code>quick-lint-js-build-tools</code> CMake target:
      </p>

      <blockquote>
        <pre><code class="shell-session"><kbd>cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -S . -B build-tools -G Ninja</kbd>
<span class="long-shell-command-line"><kbd>cmake --build build-tools --config Release --target quick-lint-js-build-tools</kbd></span></code></pre>
      </blockquote>

      <p>
        After building the tools for the build machine, configure CMake for the
        target machine. Set the
        <code>QUICK_LINT_JS_USE_BUILD_TOOLS</code> CMake variable to the
        <code>build-tools</code> directory we created with the previous
        commands. For example:
      </p>

      <blockquote>
        <pre><code class="shell-session"><span class="long-shell-command-line"><kbd>cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=~/MyToolchain.cmake -DQUICK_LINT_JS_USE_BUILD_TOOLS="${PWD}/build-tools" -S . -B build -G Ninja</kbd></span>
<span class="long-shell-command-line"><kbd>cmake --build build --config Release</kbd></span></code></pre>
      </blockquote>
