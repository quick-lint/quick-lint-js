      <p>
        Building quick-lint-js from source using Nix is for advanced users only.
        You need to
        <a href="https://nixos.org/download.html"
          >install the Nix package manager</a
        >
        if you have not already done so.
      </p>

      <p>
        <a href="https://nixos.org/manual/nix/stable/">Nix</a> uses derivation
        files that contain instructions for automation on how to build and
        package software. The <code>dist/</code> folder contains such
        derivations for quick-lint-js and can be used to download dependencies
        and build it.
      </p>

      <h4>0. Prepare environment</h4>

      <p>
        The derivations in <code>dist/</code> contain the necessary dependencies
        to build quick-lint-js using cmake and ninja. We can use
        <code>nix-shell</code> to download those dependencies and make them
        available for development.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
        <pre><code class="shell-session"><kbd>nix-shell dist/nix/shell.nix</kbd></code></pre>
      </blockquote>

      <p>
        While it seems this does not do anything, you will be dropped in a shell
        that has the build tools available necessary to build quick-lint-js.
        Once you exit this shell, the downloaded dependencies will not be
        available anymore. You can use the above command again to re-create a
        shell with the build tools available at any time.
      </p>

      <h4>1. Configure</h4>

      <p>After running above command, we configure the build environment:</p>
      <blockquote>
        <pre><code class="shell-session"><kbd>cmakeConfigurePhase</kbd></code></pre>
      </blockquote>

      <p>
        This will create a <code>build/</code> folder in the project folder and
        changes the current directory to it.
      </p>

      <h4>2. Build</h4>

      <p>
        To build quick-lint-js, make sure you are in the
        <code>build/</code> folder; the previous command should have already put
        you there. To start the build using ninja, you use:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
        <pre><code class="shell-session"><kbd>ninjaBuildPhase</kbd></code></pre>
      </blockquote>

      <h4>3. Run</h4>

      <p>
        After building, the binary is available as <code>quick-lint-js</code> in
        the build folder:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
        <pre><code class="shell-session"><kbd>./quick-lint-js --help</kbd></code></pre>
      </blockquote>

      <p>To run the tests, execute the test binary in the build directory:</p>
      <blockquote>
        <pre><code class="shell-session"><kbd>./test/quick-lint-js-test</kbd></code></pre>
      </blockquote>
    </main>
