          Creative Commons Corporation ("Creative Commons") is not a law firm
          and does not provide legal services or legal advice. Distribution of
          Creative Commons public licenses does not create a lawyer-client or

          information available on an "as-is" basis. Creative Commons gives no
          warranties regarding its licenses, any material licensed under their

        <h4>Using Creative Commons Public Licenses</h4>

        <p>
          Creative Commons public licenses provide a standard set of terms and
          conditions that creators and other rights holders may use to share
          original works of authorship and other material subject to copyright
          and certain other rights specified in the public license below. The
          following considerations are for informational purposes only, are not
          exhaustive, and do not form part of our licenses.
        </p>

        <blockquote>
          <p>
            Considerations for licensors: Our public licenses are intended for
            use by those authorized to give the public permission to use
            material in ways otherwise restricted by copyright and certain other
            rights. Our licenses are irrevocable. Licensors should read and
            understand the terms and conditions of the license they choose
            before applying it. Licensors should also secure all rights
            necessary before applying our licenses so that the public can reuse
            the material as expected. Licensors should clearly mark any material
            not subject to the license. This includes other CC- licensed
            material, or material used under an exception or limitation to
            copyright. More considerations for licensors:

              >wiki.creativecommons.org/Considerations_for_licensors</a
            >
          </p>

          <p>
            Considerations for the public: By using one of our public licenses,
            a licensor grants the public permission to use the licensed material
            under specified terms and conditions. If the licensor's permission
            is not necessary for any reason--for example, because of any
            applicable exception or limitation to copyright--then that use is
            not regulated by the license. Our licenses grant only permissions
            under copyright and certain other rights that a licensor has
            authority to grant. Use of the licensed material may still be
            restricted for other reasons, including because others have
            copyright or other rights in the material. A licensor may make
            special requests, such as asking that all changes be marked or
            described. Although not required by our licenses, you are encouraged
            to respect those requests where reasonable. More_considerations for
            the public:

                Exceptions and Limitations apply to Your use, this Public
                License does not apply, and You do not need to comply with its
                terms and conditions.

              <li>

                this Public License, simply making modifications authorized by
                this Section 2(a) (4) never produces Adapted Material.

          This license establishes the terms under which a given free software
          Package may be copied, modified, distributed, and/or redistributed.

          Package available as open source and free software.
        </p>

        <p>
          You are always permitted to make arrangements wholly outside of this
          license directly with the Copyright Holder of a given Package. If the
          terms of this license do not permit the full use that you propose to
          make of the Package, you should contact the Copyright Holder and seek
          a different licensing arrangement.

            You may apply any bug fixes, portability changes, and other
            modifications made available from the Copyright Holder. The

          <p>Distribution of Modified Versions of the Package as Source</p>
          <li>
            You may Distribute your Modified Version as Source (either gratis or
            for a Distributor Fee, and with or without a Compiled form of the
            Modified Version) provided that you clearly document how it differs
            from the Standard Version, including, but not limited to,
            documenting any non-standard features, executables, or modules, and
            provided that you do at least ONE of the following:

            <ol type="a">
              <li>
                make the Modified Version available to the Copyright Holder of
                the Standard Version, under the Original License, so that the
                Copyright Holder may include your modifications in the Standard
                Version.
              </li>

              <li>
                ensure that installation of your Modified Version does not
                prevent the user installing or running the Standard Version. In
                addition, the Modified Version must bear a name that is
                different from the name of the Standard Version.
              </li>

              <li>
                allow anyone who receives a copy of the Modified Version to make
                the Source form of the Modified Version available to others
                under
                <ol type="i">
                  <li>the Original License or</li>

                  <li>
                    a license that permits the licensee to freely copy, modify
                    and redistribute the Modified Version using the same
                    licensing terms that apply to the copy that the licensee
                    received, and requires that the Source form of the Modified
                    Version, and of any works derived from it, be made freely
                    available in that license fees are prohibited but
                    Distributor Fees are allowed.

            Distribution of Compiled Forms of the Standard Version or Modified
            Versions without the Source
          </p>
          <li>
            You may Distribute Compiled forms of the Standard Version without
            the Source, provided that you include complete instructions on how
            to get the Source of the Standard Version. Such instructions must be
            valid at the time of your distribution. If these instructions, at
            any time while you are carrying out such distribution, become
            invalid, you must provide new instructions on demand or cease
            further distribution. If you provide valid instructions or cease
            distribution within thirty days after you become aware that the
            instructions are invalid, then you do not forfeit any of your rights
            under this license.
          </li>

          <li>
            You may Distribute a Modified Version in Compiled form without the
            Source, provided that you comply with Section 4 with respect to the
            Source of the Modified Version.
          </li>

          <p>Aggregating or Linking the Package</p>
          <li>
            You may aggregate the Package (either the Standard Version or
            Modified Version) with other packages and Distribute the resulting
            aggregation provided that you do not charge a licensing fee for the
            Package. Distributor Fees are permitted, and licensing fees for
            other components in the aggregation are permitted. The terms of this
            license apply to the use and Distribution of the Standard or
            Modified Versions as included in the aggregation.
          </li>

          <li>
            You are permitted to link Modified and Standard Versions with other
            works, to embed the Package in a larger work of your own, or to
            build stand-alone binary or bytecode versions of applications that
            include the Package, and Distribute the result without restriction,
            provided the result does not expose a direct interface to the
            Package.
          </li>

          <p>Items That are Not Considered Part of a Modified Version</p>
          <li>
            Works (including, but not limited to, modules and scripts) that
            merely extend or make use of the Package, do not, by themselves,
            cause the Package to be a Modified Version. In addition, such works
            are not considered parts of the Package itself, and are not subject
            to the terms of this license.
          </li>

          <p>General Provisions</p>
          <li>
            Any use, modification, and distribution of the Standard or Modified
            Versions is governed by this Artistic License. By using, modifying
            or distributing the Package, you accept this license. Do not use,
            modify, or distribute the Package, if you do not accept this
            license.
          </li>

          <li>
            If your Modified Version has been derived from a Modified Version
            made by someone other than you, you are nevertheless required to
            ensure that your Modified Version complies with the requirements of
            this license.
          </li>

          <li>
            This license does not grant you the right to use any trademark,
            service mark, tradename, or logo of the Copyright Holder.

            licensable by the Copyright Holder that are necessarily infringed by
            the Package. If you institute patent litigation (including a

            Package constitutes direct or contributory patent infringement, then
            this Artistic License to you shall terminate on the date that such
            litigation is filed.

        <ol type="I">
          <li>
            There are no restrictions on distributing unmodified copies of Vim
            except that they must include this license text. You can also
            distribute unmodified parts of Vim, likewise unrestricted except
            that they must include this license text. You are also allowed to
            include executables that you made from the unmodified Vim sources,
            plus your own usage examples and Vim scripts.
          </li>

          <li>
            It is allowed to distribute a modified (or extended) version of Vim,
            including executables and/or source code, when the following four
            conditions are met:
            <ol type="1">
              <li>This license text must be included unmodified.</li>
              <li>
                The modified Vim must be distributed in one of the following
                five ways:
                <ol type="a">
                  <li>
                    If you make changes to Vim yourself, you must clearly
                    describe in the distribution how to contact you. When the
                    maintainer asks you (in any way) for a copy of the modified
                    Vim you distributed, you must make your changes, including
                    source code, available to the maintainer without fee. The
                    maintainer reserves the right to include your changes in the
                    official version of Vim. What the maintainer will do with
                    your changes and under what license they will be distributed
                    is negotiable. If there has been no negotiation then this
                    license, or a later version, also applies to your changes.
                    The current maintainer is Bram Moolenaar
                    <a href="mailto:Bram@vim.org">Bram@vim.org</a>. If this
                    changes it will be announced in appropriate places (most
                    likely <a href="http://vim.sf.net">vim.sf.net</a>,
                    <a href="https://www.vim.org">www.vim.org</a> and/or
                    comp.editors). When it is completely impossible to contact
                    the maintainer, the obligation to send him your changes
                    ceases. Once the maintainer has confirmed that he has
                    received your changes they will not have to be sent again.
                  </li>

                  <li>
                    If you have received a modified Vim that was distributed as
                    mentioned under a) you are allowed to further distribute it
                    unmodified, as mentioned at I). If you make additional
                    changes the text under a) applies to those changes.
                  </li>

                  <li>
                    Provide all the changes, including source code, with every
                    copy of the modified Vim you distribute. This may be done in
                    the form of a context diff. You can choose what license to
                    use for new code you add. The changes and their license must
                    not restrict others from making their own changes to the
                    official version of Vim.
                  </li>

                  <li>
                    When you have a modified Vim which includes changes as
                    mentioned under c), you can distribute it without the source
                    code for the changes if the following three conditions are
                    met:
                    <ul>
                      <li>
                        The license that applies to the changes permits you to
                        distribute the changes to the Vim maintainer without fee
                        or restriction, and permits the Vim maintainer to
                        include the changes in the official version of Vim
                        without fee or restriction.

                      <li>
                        You keep the changes for at least three years after last
                        distributing the corresponding modified Vim. When the
                        maintainer or someone who you distributed the modified
                        Vim to asks you (in any way) for the changes within this
                        period, you must make them available to him.
                      </li>

                      <li>
                        You clearly describe in the distribution how to contact
                        you. This contact information must remain valid for at
                        least three years after last distributing the
                        corresponding modified Vim, or as long as possible.

                    When the GNU General Public License (GPL) applies to the
                    changes, you can distribute the modified Vim under the GNU
                    GPL version 2 or any later version.

              <li>
                A message must be added, at least in the output of the
                ":version" command and in the intro screen, such that the user
                of the modified Vim is able to see that it was modified. When
                distributing as mentioned under 2)e) adding the message is only
                required for as far as this does not conflict with the license
                used for the changes.
              </li>

              <li>
                The contact information as required under 2)a) and 2)d) must not
                be removed or changed, except that the person himself can make
                corrections.

          </li>

          <li>
            If you distribute a modified version of Vim, you are encouraged to
            use the Vim license for your changes and make them available to the
            maintainer, including the source code. The preferred way to do this
            is by e-mail or by uploading the files to a server and e-mailing the
            URL. If the number of changes is small (e.g., a modified Makefile)
            e-mailing a context diff will do. The e-mail address to be used is
            <a href="mailto:maintainer@vim.org">maintainer@vim.org</a>
          </li>

          <li>
            It is not allowed to remove this license from the distribution of
            the Vim sources, parts of it or from a modified version. You may use
            this license for previous Vim releases instead of the license that
            they came with, at your option.

                <strong>Processing of Personal Data.</strong>
                To the extent Microsoft is a processor or subprocessor of
                personal data in connection with the software, Microsoft makes

          <li>
            <strong>UPDATES.</strong>
            The software may periodically check for updates and download and
            install them for you. You may obtain updates only from Microsoft or
            authorized sources. Microsoft may need to update your system to
            provide you with updates. You agree to receive these automatic
            updates without any additional notice. Updates may not include or
            support all existing software features, services, or peripheral
            devices. If you do not want automatic updates, you may turn them off
            by following the instructions in the documentation at
            <a href="https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=616397"

            <strong>FEEDBACK.</strong>
            If you give feedback about the software to Microsoft, you give to
            Microsoft, without charge, the right to use, share and commercialize
            your feedback in any way and for any purpose. You will not give
            feedback that is subject to a license that requires Microsoft to
            license its software or documentation to third parties because we
            include your feedback in them. These rights survive this agreement.
          </li>

          <li>
            <strong>SCOPE OF LICENSE.</strong>
            This license applies to the Visual Studio Code product. Source code

            under the MIT license agreement. The software is licensed, not sold.
            This agreement only gives you some rights to use the software.
            Microsoft reserves all other rights. Unless applicable law gives you
            more rights despite this limitation, you may use the software only
            as expressly permitted in this agreement. In doing so, you must
            comply with any technical limitations in the software that only
            allow you to use it in certain ways. You may not
            <ul style="list-style-type: disc">
              <li>
                reverse engineer, decompile or disassemble the software, or
                otherwise attempt to derive the source code for the software
                except and solely to the extent required by third party
                licensing terms governing use of certain open source components
                that may be included in the software;

                remove, minimize, block or modify any notices of Microsoft or
                its suppliers in the software;
              </li>
              <li>use the software in any way that is against the law;</li>
              <li>

              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>

          <li>
            <strong>SUPPORT SERVICES.</strong>
            Because this software is “as is,” we may not provide support
            services for it.
          </li>

          <li>
            <strong>ENTIRE AGREEMENT.</strong>
            This agreement, and the terms for supplements, updates,
            Internet-based services and support services that you use, are the
            entire agreement for the software and support services.
          </li>

          <li>
            <strong>EXPORT RESTRICTIONS.</strong>
            You must comply with all domestic and international export laws and
            regulations that apply to the software, which include restrictions
            on destinations, end-users, and end use. For further information on
            export restrictions, see
            <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/exporting"
              >https://www.microsoft.com/exporting</a
            >.
          </li>

          <li>
            <strong>APPLICABLE LAW.</strong>
            If you acquired the software in the United States, Washington law
            applies to interpretation of and claims for breach of this
            agreement, and the laws of the state where you live apply to all
            other claims. If you acquired the software in any other country, its
            laws apply.
          </li>

          <li>
            <strong>CONSUMER RIGHTS; REGIONAL VARIATIONS.</strong>
            This agreement describes certain legal rights. You may have other
            rights, including consumer rights, under the laws of your state or
            country. Separate and apart from your relationship with Microsoft,
            you may also have rights with respect to the party from which you
            acquired the software. This agreement does not change those other
            rights if the laws of your state or country do not permit it to do
            so. For example, if you acquired the software in one of the below
            regions, or mandatory country law applies, then the following
            provisions apply to you:

            <ol type="a">
              <li>
                <strong>Australia.</strong>
                You have statutory guarantees under the Australian Consumer Law
                and nothing in this agreement is intended to affect those
                rights.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Canada.</strong>
                If you acquired this software in Canada, you may stop receiving
                updates by turning off the automatic update feature,
                disconnecting your device from the Internet (if and when you
                re-connect to the Internet, however, the software will resume
                checking for and installing updates), or uninstalling the
                software. The product documentation, if any, may also specify
                how to turn off updates for your specific device or software.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Germany and Austria.</strong>

                <ol type="i">
                  <li>
                    <strong>Warranty.</strong>
                    The properly licensed software will perform substantially as
                    described in any Microsoft materials that accompany the
                    software. However, Microsoft gives no contractual guarantee
                    in relation to the licensed software.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <strong>Limitation of Liability.</strong>
                    In case of intentional conduct, gross negligence, claims
                    based on the Product Liability Act, as well as, in case of
                    death or personal or physical injury, Microsoft is liable
                    according to the statutory law.
                  </li>
                </ol>

                <p>
                  Subject to the foregoing clause (ii), Microsoft will only be
                  liable for slight negligence if Microsoft is in breach of such
                  material contractual obligations, the fulfillment of which
                  facilitate the due performance of this agreement, the breach
                  of which would endanger the purpose of this agreement and the
                  compliance with which a party may constantly trust in
                  (so-called "cardinal obligations"). In other cases of slight
                  negligence, Microsoft will not be liable for slight
                  negligence.
                </p>
              </li>

              >DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY. The software is licensed

              express warranties, guarantees or conditions. To the extent
              permitted under your local laws, Microsoft excludes the implied

                Microsoft and its suppliers only direct damages up to U.S.
                $5.00. You cannot recover any other damages, including
                consequential, lost profits, special, indirect or incidental

            <p>
              This limitation applies to (a) anything related to the software,
              services, content (including code) on third party Internet sites,
              or third party applications; and (b) claims for breach of
              contract, breach of warranty, guarantee or condition, strict
              liability, negligence, or other tort to the extent permitted by
              applicable law.
            </p>
            <p>
              It also applies even if Microsoft knew or should have known about
              the possibility of the damages. The above limitation or exclusion
              may not apply to you because your state or country may not allow
              the exclusion or limitation of incidental, consequential or other
              damages.
