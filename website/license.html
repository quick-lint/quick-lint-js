          Creative Commons Corporation ("Creative Commons") is not a law firm
          and does not provide legal services or legal advice. Distribution of

        <h4>Using Creative Commons Public Licenses</h4>

        <p>
          Creative Commons public licenses provide a standard set of terms and
          conditions that creators and other rights holders may use to share
          original works of authorship and other material subject to copyright
          and certain other rights specified in the public license below. The
          following considerations are for informational purposes only, are not
          exhaustive, and do not form part of our licenses.
        </p>

        <blockquote>
          <p>
            Considerations for licensors: Our public licenses are intended for
            use by those authorized to give the public permission to use
            material in ways otherwise restricted by copyright and certain other
            rights. Our licenses are irrevocable. Licensors should read and
            understand the terms and conditions of the license they choose
            before applying it. Licensors should also secure all rights
            necessary before applying our licenses so that the public can reuse
            the material as expected. Licensors should clearly mark any material
            not subject to the license. This includes other CC- licensed
            material, or material used under an exception or limitation to
            copyright. More considerations for licensors:

              >wiki.creativecommons.org/Considerations_for_licensors</a
            >
          </p>

          <p>
            Considerations for the public: By using one of our public licenses,
            a licensor grants the public permission to use the licensed material
            under specified terms and conditions. If the licensor's permission
            is not necessary for any reason--for example, because of any
            applicable exception or limitation to copyright--then that use is
            not regulated by the license. Our licenses grant only permissions
            under copyright and certain other rights that a licensor has
            authority to grant. Use of the licensed material may still be
            restricted for other reasons, including because others have
            copyright or other rights in the material. A licensor may make
            special requests, such as asking that all changes be marked or
            described. Although not required by our licenses, you are encouraged
            to respect those requests where reasonable. More_considerations for
            the public:

        <p>
          Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this
          license document, but changing it is not allowed.
        </p>

        <h4>Preamble</h4>
        <p>
          The GNU General Public License is a free, copyleft license for
          software and other kinds of works.
        </p>

        <p>
          The licenses for most software and other practical works are designed
          to take away your freedom to share and change the works. By contrast,
          the GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom
          to share and change all versions of a program--to make sure it remains
          free software for all its users. We, the Free Software Foundation, use
          the GNU General Public License for most of our software; it applies
          also to any other work released this way by its authors. You can apply
          it to your programs, too.
        </p>

        <p>
          When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not
          price. Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you
          have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for
          them if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you
          want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new
          free programs, and that you know you can do these things.
        </p>

        <p>
          To protect your rights, we need to prevent others from denying you
          these rights or asking you to surrender the rights. Therefore, you
          have certain responsibilities if you distribute copies of the
          software, or if you modify it: responsibilities to respect the freedom
          of others.
        </p>

        <p>
          For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether
          gratis or for a fee, you must pass on to the recipients the same
          freedoms that you received. You must make sure that they, too, receive
          or can get the source code. And you must show them these terms so they
          know their rights.
        </p>

        <p>
          Developers that use the GNU GPL protect your rights with two steps:
          (1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer you this License
          giving you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify it.
        </p>

        <p>
          For the developers' and authors' protection, the GPL clearly explains
          that there is no warranty for this free software. For both users' and
          authors' sake, the GPL requires that modified versions be marked as
          changed, so that their problems will not be attributed erroneously to
          authors of previous versions.
        </p>

        <p>
          Some devices are designed to deny users access to install or run
          modified versions of the software inside them, although the
          manufacturer can do so. This is fundamentally incompatible with the
          aim of protecting users' freedom to change the software. The
          systematic pattern of such abuse occurs in the area of products for
          individuals to use, which is precisely where it is most unacceptable.
          Therefore, we have designed this version of the GPL to prohibit the
          practice for those products. If such problems arise substantially in
          other domains, we stand ready to extend this provision to those
          domains in future versions of the GPL, as needed to protect the
          freedom of users.
        </p>

        <p>
          Finally, every program is threatened constantly by software patents.
          States should not allow patents to restrict development and use of
          software on general-purpose computers, but in those that do, we wish
          to avoid the special danger that patents applied to a free program
          could make it effectively proprietary. To prevent this, the GPL
          assures that patents cannot be used to render the program non-free.
        </p>

        <p>
          The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
          modification follow.
        </p>

        <h4>TERMS AND CONDITIONS</h4>
        <h5>0. Definitions.</h5>
        <p>
          “This License” refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License.
        </p>

        <p>
          “Copyright” also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds
          of works, such as semiconductor masks.
        </p>

        <p>
          “The Program” refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this
          License. Each licensee is addressed as “you”. “Licensees” and
          “recipients” may be individuals or organizations.
        </p>

        <p>
          To “modify” a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work
          in a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making of
          an exact copy. The resulting work is called a “modified version” of
          the earlier work or a work “based on” the earlier work.
        </p>

        <p>
          A “covered work” means either the unmodified Program or a work based
          on the Program.
        </p>

        <p>
          To “propagate” a work means to do anything with it that, without
          permission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for
          infringement under applicable copyright law, except executing it on a
          computer or modifying a private copy. Propagation includes copying,
          distribution (with or without modification), making available to the
          public, and in some countries other activities as well.
        </p>

        <p>
          To “convey” a work means any kind of propagation that enables other
          parties to make or receive copies. Mere interaction with a user
          through a computer network, with no transfer of a copy, is not
          conveying.
        </p>

        <p>
          An interactive user interface displays “Appropriate Legal Notices” to
          the extent that it includes a convenient and prominently visible
          feature that (1) displays an appropriate copyright notice, and (2)
          tells the user that there is no warranty for the work (except to the
          extent that warranties are provided), that licensees may convey the
          work under this License, and how to view a copy of this License. If
          the interface presents a list of user commands or options, such as a
          menu, a prominent item in the list meets this criterion.
        </p>

        <h5>1. Source Code.</h5>
        <p>
          The “source code” for a work means the preferred form of the work for
          making modifications to it. “Object code” means any non-source form of
          a work.
        </p>

        <p>
          A “Standard Interface” means an interface that either is an official
          standard defined by a recognized standards body, or, in the case of
          interfaces specified for a particular programming language, one that
          is widely used among developers working in that language.
        </p>

        <p>
          The “System Libraries” of an executable work include anything, other
          than the work as a whole, that (a) is included in the normal form of
          packaging a Major Component, but which is not part of that Major
          Component, and (b) serves only to enable use of the work with that
          Major Component, or to implement a Standard Interface for which an
          implementation is available to the public in source code form. A
          “Major Component”, in this context, means a major essential component
          (kernel, window system, and so on) of the specific operating system
          (if any) on which the executable work runs, or a compiler used to
          produce the work, or an object code interpreter used to run it.
        </p>

        <p>
          The “Corresponding Source” for a work in object code form means all
          the source code needed to generate, install, and (for an executable
          work) run the object code and to modify the work, including scripts to
          control those activities. However, it does not include the work's
          System Libraries, or general-purpose tools or generally available free
          programs which are used unmodified in performing those activities but
          which are not part of the work. For example, Corresponding Source
          includes interface definition files associated with source files for
          the work, and the source code for shared libraries and dynamically
          linked subprograms that the work is specifically designed to require,
          such as by intimate data communication or control flow between those
          subprograms and other parts of the work.
        </p>

        <p>
          The Corresponding Source need not include anything that users can
          regenerate automatically from other parts of the Corresponding Source.
        </p>

        <p>
          The Corresponding Source for a work in source code form is that same
          work.
        </p>

        <h5>2. Basic Permissions.</h5>
        <p>
          All rights granted under this License are granted for the term of
          copyright on the Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated
          conditions are met. This License explicitly affirms your unlimited
          permission to run the unmodified Program. The output from running a
          covered work is covered by this License only if the output, given its
          content, constitutes a covered work. This License acknowledges your
          rights of fair use or other equivalent, as provided by copyright law.
        </p>

        <p>
          You may make, run and propagate covered works that you do not convey,
          without conditions so long as your license otherwise remains in force.
          You may convey covered works to others for the sole purpose of having
          them make modifications exclusively for you, or provide you with
          facilities for running those works, provided that you comply with the
          terms of this License in conveying all material for which you do not
          control copyright. Those thus making or running the covered works for
          you must do so exclusively on your behalf, under your direction and
          control, on terms that prohibit them from making any copies of your
          copyrighted material outside their relationship with you.
        </p>

        <p>
          Conveying under any other circumstances is permitted solely under the
          conditions stated below. Sublicensing is not allowed; section 10 makes
          it unnecessary.
        </p>

        <h5>3. Protecting Users' Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law.</h5>
        <p>
          No covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological
          measure under any applicable law fulfilling obligations under article
          11 of the WIPO copyright treaty adopted on 20 December 1996, or
          similar laws prohibiting or restricting circumvention of such
          measures.
        </p>

        <p>
          When you convey a covered work, you waive any legal power to forbid
          circumvention of technological measures to the extent such
          circumvention is effected by exercising rights under this License with
          respect to the covered work, and you disclaim any intention to limit
          operation or modification of the work as a means of enforcing, against
          the work's users, your or third parties' legal rights to forbid
          circumvention of technological measures.
        </p>

        <h5>4. Conveying Verbatim Copies.</h5>
        <p>
          You may convey verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you
          receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and
          appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice;
          keep intact all notices stating that this License and any
          non-permissive terms added in accord with section 7 apply to the code;
          keep intact all notices of the absence of any warranty; and give all
          recipients a copy of this License along with the Program.
        </p>

        <p>
          You may charge any price or no price for each copy that you convey,
          and you may offer support or warranty protection for a fee.
        </p>

        <h5>5. Conveying Modified Source Versions.</h5>
        <p>
          You may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications to
          produce it from the Program, in the form of source code under the
          terms of section 4, provided that you also meet all of these
          conditions:
        </p>

        <ol type="a">
          <li>
            The work must carry prominent notices stating that you modified it,
            and giving a relevant date.
          </li>
          <li>
            The work must carry prominent notices stating that it is released
            under this License and any conditions added under section 7. This
            requirement modifies the requirement in section 4 to “keep intact
            all notices”.
          </li>
          <li>
            You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this License to
            anyone who comes into possession of a copy. This License will
            therefore apply, along with any applicable section 7 additional
            terms, to the whole of the work, and all its parts, regardless of
            how they are packaged. This License gives no permission to license
            the work in any other way, but it does not invalidate such
            permission if you have separately received it.
          </li>
          <li>
            If the work has interactive user interfaces, each must display
            Appropriate Legal Notices; however, if the Program has interactive
            interfaces that do not display Appropriate Legal Notices, your work
            need not make them do so.
          </li>
        </ol>
        <p>
          A compilation of a covered work with other separate and independent
          works, which are not by their nature extensions of the covered work,
          and which are not combined with it such as to form a larger program,
          in or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is called an
          “aggregate” if the compilation and its resulting copyright are not
          used to limit the access or legal rights of the compilation's users
          beyond what the individual works permit. Inclusion of a covered work
          in an aggregate does not cause this License to apply to the other
          parts of the aggregate.
        </p>

        <h5>6. Conveying Non-Source Forms.</h5>
        <p>
          You may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms of
          sections 4 and 5, provided that you also convey the machine-readable
          Corresponding Source under the terms of this License, in one of these
          ways:
        </p>

        <ol type="a">
          <li>
            Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product
            (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by the
            Corresponding Source fixed on a durable physical medium customarily
            used for software interchange.
          </li>
          <li>
            Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product
            (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by a written
            offer, valid for at least three years and valid for as long as you
            offer spare parts or customer support for that product model, to
            give anyone who possesses the object code either (1) a copy of the
            Corresponding Source for all the software in the product that is
            covered by this License, on a durable physical medium customarily
            used for software interchange, for a price no more than your
            reasonable cost of physically performing this conveying of source,
            or (2) access to copy the Corresponding Source from a network server
            at no charge.
          </li>
          <li>
            Convey individual copies of the object code with a copy of the
            written offer to provide the Corresponding Source. This alternative
            is allowed only occasionally and noncommercially, and only if you
            received the object code with such an offer, in accord with
            subsection 6b.
          </li>
          <li>
            Convey the object code by offering access from a designated place
            (gratis or for a charge), and offer equivalent access to the
            Corresponding Source in the same way through the same place at no
            further charge. You need not require recipients to copy the
            Corresponding Source along with the object code. If the place to
            copy the object code is a network server, the Corresponding Source
            may be on a different server (operated by you or a third party) that
            supports equivalent copying facilities, provided you maintain clear
            directions next to the object code saying where to find the
            Corresponding Source. Regardless of what server hosts the
            Corresponding Source, you remain obligated to ensure that it is
            available for as long as needed to satisfy these requirements.
          </li>
          <li>
            Convey the object code using peer-to-peer transmission, provided you
            inform other peers where the object code and Corresponding Source of
            the work are being offered to the general public at no charge under
            subsection 6d.
          </li>
        </ol>
        <p>
          A separable portion of the object code, whose source code is excluded
          from the Corresponding Source as a System Library, need not be
          included in conveying the object code work.
        </p>

        <p>
          A “User Product” is either (1) a “consumer product”, which means any
          tangible personal property which is normally used for personal,
          family, or household purposes, or (2) anything designed or sold for
          incorporation into a dwelling. In determining whether a product is a
          consumer product, doubtful cases shall be resolved in favor of
          coverage. For a particular product received by a particular user,
          “normally used” refers to a typical or common use of that class of
          product, regardless of the status of the particular user or of the way
          in which the particular user actually uses, or expects or is expected
          to use, the product. A product is a consumer product regardless of
          whether the product has substantial commercial, industrial or
          non-consumer uses, unless such uses represent the only significant
          mode of use of the product.
        </p>

        <p>
          “Installation Information” for a User Product means any methods,
          procedures, authorization keys, or other information required to
          install and execute modified versions of a covered work in that User
          Product from a modified version of its Corresponding Source. The
          information must suffice to ensure that the continued functioning of
          the modified object code is in no case prevented or interfered with
          solely because modification has been made.
        </p>

        <p>
          If you convey an object code work under this section in, or with, or
          specifically for use in, a User Product, and the conveying occurs as
          part of a transaction in which the right of possession and use of the
          User Product is transferred to the recipient in perpetuity or for a
          fixed term (regardless of how the transaction is characterized), the
          Corresponding Source conveyed under this section must be accompanied
          by the Installation Information. But this requirement does not apply
          if neither you nor any third party retains the ability to install
          modified object code on the User Product (for example, the work has
          been installed in ROM).
        </p>

        <p>
          The requirement to provide Installation Information does not include a
          requirement to continue to provide support service, warranty, or
          updates for a work that has been modified or installed by the
          recipient, or for the User Product in which it has been modified or
          installed. Access to a network may be denied when the modification
          itself materially and adversely affects the operation of the network
          or violates the rules and protocols for communication across the
          network.
        </p>

        <p>
          Corresponding Source conveyed, and Installation Information provided,
          in accord with this section must be in a format that is publicly
          documented (and with an implementation available to the public in
          source code form), and must require no special password or key for
          unpacking, reading or copying.
        </p>

        <h5>7. Additional Terms.</h5>
        <p>
          “Additional permissions” are terms that supplement the terms of this
          License by making exceptions from one or more of its conditions.
          Additional permissions that are applicable to the entire Program shall
          be treated as though they were included in this License, to the extent
          that they are valid under applicable law. If additional permissions
          apply only to part of the Program, that part may be used separately
          under those permissions, but the entire Program remains governed by
          this License without regard to the additional permissions.
        </p>

        <p>
          When you convey a copy of a covered work, you may at your option
          remove any additional permissions from that copy, or from any part of
          it. (Additional permissions may be written to require their own
          removal in certain cases when you modify the work.) You may place
          additional permissions on material, added by you to a covered work,
          for which you have or can give appropriate copyright permission.
        </p>

        <p>
          Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, for material you
          add to a covered work, you may (if authorized by the copyright holders
          of that material) supplement the terms of this License with terms:
        </p>

        <ol type="a">
          <li>
            Disclaiming warranty or limiting liability differently from the
            terms of sections 15 and 16 of this License; or
          </li>
          <li>
            Requiring preservation of specified reasonable legal notices or
            author attributions in that material or in the Appropriate Legal
            Notices displayed by works containing it; or
          </li>
          <li>
            Prohibiting misrepresentation of the origin of that material, or
            requiring that modified versions of such material be marked in
            reasonable ways as different from the original version; or
          </li>
          <li>
            Limiting the use for publicity purposes of names of licensors or
            authors of the material; or
          </li>
          <li>
            Declining to grant rights under trademark law for use of some trade
            names, trademarks, or service marks; or
          </li>
          <li>
            Requiring indemnification of licensors and authors of that material
            by anyone who conveys the material (or modified versions of it) with
            contractual assumptions of liability to the recipient, for any
            liability that these contractual assumptions directly impose on
            those licensors and authors.
          </li>
        </ol>
        <p>
          All other non-permissive additional terms are considered “further
          restrictions” within the meaning of section 10. If the Program as you
          received it, or any part of it, contains a notice stating that it is
          governed by this License along with a term that is a further
          restriction, you may remove that term. If a license document contains
          a further restriction but permits relicensing or conveying under this
          License, you may add to a covered work material governed by the terms
          of that license document, provided that the further restriction does
          not survive such relicensing or conveying.
        </p>

        <p>
          If you add terms to a covered work in accord with this section, you
          must place, in the relevant source files, a statement of the
          additional terms that apply to those files, or a notice indicating
          where to find the applicable terms.
        </p>

        <p>
          Additional terms, permissive or non-permissive, may be stated in the
          form of a separately written license, or stated as exceptions; the
          above requirements apply either way.
        </p>

        <h5>8. Termination.</h5>
        <p>
          You may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly
          provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise to propagate or
          modify it is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under
          this License (including any patent licenses granted under the third
          paragraph of section 11).
        </p>

        <p>
          However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your license
          from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a) provisionally,
          unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and finally
          terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright holder
          fails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means prior to
          60 days after the cessation.
        </p>

        <p>
          Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is
          reinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the
          violation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have
          received notice of violation of this License (for any work) from that
          copyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after
          your receipt of the notice.
        </p>

        <p>
          Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the
          licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under
          this License. If your rights have been terminated and not permanently
          reinstated, you do not qualify to receive new licenses for the same
          material under section 10.
        </p>

        <h5>9. Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies.</h5>
        <p>
          You are not required to accept this License in order to receive or run
          a copy of the Program. Ancillary propagation of a covered work
          occurring solely as a consequence of using peer-to-peer transmission
          to receive a copy likewise does not require acceptance. However,
          nothing other than this License grants you permission to propagate or
          modify any covered work. These actions infringe copyright if you do
          not accept this License. Therefore, by modifying or propagating a
          covered work, you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so.
        </p>

        <h5>10. Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients.</h5>
        <p>
          Each time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically
          receives a license from the original licensors, to run, modify and
          propagate that work, subject to this License. You are not responsible
          for enforcing compliance by third parties with this License.
        </p>

        <p>
          An “entity transaction” is a transaction transferring control of an
          organization, or substantially all assets of one, or subdividing an
          organization, or merging organizations. If propagation of a covered
          work results from an entity transaction, each party to that
          transaction who receives a copy of the work also receives whatever
          licenses to the work the party's predecessor in interest had or could
          give under the previous paragraph, plus a right to possession of the
          Corresponding Source of the work from the predecessor in interest, if
          the predecessor has it or can get it with reasonable efforts.
        </p>

        <p>
          You may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the
          rights granted or affirmed under this License. For example, you may
          not impose a license fee, royalty, or other charge for exercise of
          rights granted under this License, and you may not initiate litigation
          (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that
          any patent claim is infringed by making, using, selling, offering for
          sale, or importing the Program or any portion of it.
        </p>

        <h5>11. Patents.</h5>
        <p>
          A “contributor” is a copyright holder who authorizes use under this
          License of the Program or a work on which the Program is based. The
          work thus licensed is called the contributor's “contributor version”.
        </p>

        <p>
          A contributor's “essential patent claims” are all patent claims owned
          or controlled by the contributor, whether already acquired or
          hereafter acquired, that would be infringed by some manner, permitted
          by this License, of making, using, or selling its contributor version,
          but do not include claims that would be infringed only as a
          consequence of further modification of the contributor version. For
          purposes of this definition, “control” includes the right to grant
          patent sublicenses in a manner consistent with the requirements of
          this License.
        </p>

        <p>
          Each contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free
          patent license under the contributor's essential patent claims, to
          make, use, sell, offer for sale, import and otherwise run, modify and
          propagate the contents of its contributor version.
        </p>

        <p>
          In the following three paragraphs, a “patent license” is any express
          agreement or commitment, however denominated, not to enforce a patent
          (such as an express permission to practice a patent or covenant not to
          sue for patent infringement). To “grant” such a patent license to a
          party means to make such an agreement or commitment not to enforce a
          patent against the party.
        </p>

        <p>
          If you convey a covered work, knowingly relying on a patent license,
          and the Corresponding Source of the work is not available for anyone
          to copy, free of charge and under the terms of this License, through a
          publicly available network server or other readily accessible means,
          then you must either (1) cause the Corresponding Source to be so
          available, or (2) arrange to deprive yourself of the benefit of the
          patent license for this particular work, or (3) arrange, in a manner
          consistent with the requirements of this License, to extend the patent
          license to downstream recipients. “Knowingly relying” means you have
          actual knowledge that, but for the patent license, your conveying the
          covered work in a country, or your recipient's use of the covered work
          in a country, would infringe one or more identifiable patents in that
          country that you have reason to believe are valid.
        </p>

        <p>
          If, pursuant to or in connection with a single transaction or
          arrangement, you convey, or propagate by procuring conveyance of, a
          covered work, and grant a patent license to some of the parties
          receiving the covered work authorizing them to use, propagate, modify
          or convey a specific copy of the covered work, then the patent license
          you grant is automatically extended to all recipients of the covered
          work and works based on it.
        </p>

        <p>
          A patent license is “discriminatory” if it does not include within the
          scope of its coverage, prohibits the exercise of, or is conditioned on
          the non-exercise of one or more of the rights that are specifically
          granted under this License. You may not convey a covered work if you
          are a party to an arrangement with a third party that is in the
          business of distributing software, under which you make payment to the
          third party based on the extent of your activity of conveying the
          work, and under which the third party grants, to any of the parties
          who would receive the covered work from you, a discriminatory patent
          license (a) in connection with copies of the covered work conveyed by
          you (or copies made from those copies), or (b) primarily for and in
          connection with specific products or compilations that contain the
          covered work, unless you entered into that arrangement, or that patent
          license was granted, prior to 28 March 2007.
        </p>

        <p>
          Nothing in this License shall be construed as excluding or limiting
          any implied license or other defenses to infringement that may
          otherwise be available to you under applicable patent law.
        </p>

        <h5>12. No Surrender of Others' Freedom.</h5>
        <p>
          If conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
          otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
          excuse you from the conditions of this License. If you cannot convey a
          covered work so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under
          this License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a
          consequence you may not convey it at all. For example, if you agree to
          terms that obligate you to collect a royalty for further conveying
          from those to whom you convey the Program, the only way you could
          satisfy both those terms and this License would be to refrain entirely
          from conveying the Program.
        </p>

        <h5>13. Use with the GNU Affero General Public License.</h5>
        <p>
          Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, you have
          permission to link or combine any covered work with a work licensed
          under version 3 of the GNU Affero General Public License into a single
          combined work, and to convey the resulting work. The terms of this
          License will continue to apply to the part which is the covered work,
          but the special requirements of the GNU Affero General Public License,
          section 13, concerning interaction through a network will apply to the
          combination as such.
        </p>

        <h5>14. Revised Versions of this License.</h5>
        <p>
          The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions
          of the GNU General Public License from time to time. Such new versions
          will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in
          detail to address new problems or concerns.
        </p>

        <p>
          Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Program
          specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU General Public
          License “or any later version” applies to it, you have the option of
          following the terms and conditions either of that numbered version or
          of any later version published by the Free Software Foundation. If the
          Program does not specify a version number of the GNU General Public
          License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free
          Software Foundation.
        </p>

        <p>
          If the Program specifies that a proxy can decide which future versions
          of the GNU General Public License can be used, that proxy's public
          statement of acceptance of a version permanently authorizes you to
          choose that version for the Program.
        </p>

        <p>
          Later license versions may give you additional or different
          permissions. However, no additional obligations are imposed on any
          author or copyright holder as a result of your choosing to follow a
          later version.
        </p>

        <h5>15. Disclaimer of Warranty.</h5>
        <p>
          THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY
          APPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT
          HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM “AS IS” WITHOUT
          WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT
          LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR
          A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND
          PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE
          DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR
          CORRECTION.
        </p>

        <h5>16. Limitation of Liability.</h5>
        <p>
          IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING
          WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MODIFIES AND/OR
          CONVEYS THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES,
          INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES
          ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT
          NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR
          LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM
          TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER
          PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.
        </p>

        <h5>17. Interpretation of Sections 15 and 16.</h5>
        <p>
          If the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability provided
          above cannot be given local legal effect according to their terms,
          reviewing courts shall apply local law that most closely approximates
          an absolute waiver of all civil liability in connection with the
          Program, unless a warranty or assumption of liability accompanies a
          copy of the Program in return for a fee.
        </p>

        <h4>END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS</h4>

        <h4>How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs</h4>
        <p>
          If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest
          possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it
          free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these
          terms.
        </p>

        <p>
          To do so, attach the following notices to the program. It is safest to
          attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively state
          the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the
          “copyright” line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.
        </p>

        <blockquote>
          <pre><code>&lt;one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.&gt;

        <p>
          Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper
          mail.
        </p>

        <p>
          If the program does terminal interaction, make it output a short
          notice like this when it starts in an interactive mode:
        </p>

        <blockquote>
          <pre><code>&lt;program&gt;  Copyright (C) &lt;year&gt;  &lt;name of author&gt;

        </blockquote>
        <p>
          The hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the
          appropriate parts of the General Public License. Of course, your
          program's commands might be different; for a GUI interface, you would
          use an “about box”.
        </p>

        <p>
          You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or
          school, if any, to sign a “copyright disclaimer” for the program, if
          necessary. For more information on this, and how to apply and follow

          The GNU General Public License does not permit incorporating your

        <p>Preamble</p>

        <p>
          This license establishes the terms under which a given free software
          Package may be copied, modified, distributed, and/or redistributed.
          The intent is that the Copyright Holder maintains some artistic
          control over the development of that Package while still keeping the
          Package available as open source and free software.
        </p>

        <p>
          You are always permitted to make arrangements wholly outside of this
          license directly with the Copyright Holder of a given Package. If the
          terms of this license do not permit the full use that you propose to
          make of the Package, you should contact the Copyright Holder and seek
          a different licensing arrangement.
        </p>

        <p>Definitions</p>

        <p>
          "Copyright Holder" means the individual(s) or organization(s) named in
          the copyright notice for the entire Package.
        </p>

        <p>
          "Contributor" means any party that has contributed code or other
          material to the Package, in accordance with the Copyright Holder's
          procedures.
        </p>

        <p>
          "You" and "your" means any person who would like to copy, distribute,
          or modify the Package.
        </p>

        <p>
          "Package" means the collection of files distributed by the Copyright
          Holder, and derivatives of that collection and/or of those files. A
          given Package may consist of either the Standard Version, or a
          Modified Version.
        </p>

        <p>
          "Distribute" means providing a copy of the Package or making it
          accessible to anyone else, or in the case of a company or
          organization, to others outside of your company or organization.
        </p>

        <p>
          "Distributor Fee" means any fee that you charge for Distributing this
          Package or providing support for this Package to another party. It
          does not mean licensing fees.
        </p>

        <p>
          "Standard Version" refers to the Package if it has not been modified,
          or has been modified only in ways explicitly requested by the
          Copyright Holder.
        </p>

        <p>
          "Modified Version" means the Package, if it has been changed, and such
          changes were not explicitly requested by the Copyright Holder.
        </p>

        <p>
          "Original License" means this Artistic License as Distributed with the
          Standard Version of the Package, in its current version or as it may
          be modified by The Perl Foundation in the future.
        </p>

        <p>
          "Source" form means the source code, documentation source, and
          configuration files for the Package.
        </p>

        <p>
          "Compiled" form means the compiled bytecode, object code, binary, or

          <p>Permission for Use and Modification Without Distribution</p>
          <li>
            You are permitted to use the Standard Version and create and use
            Modified Versions for any purpose without restriction, provided that
            you do not Distribute the Modified Version.
          </li>

          <p>Permissions for Redistribution of the Standard Version</p>
          <li>
            You may Distribute verbatim copies of the Source form of the
            Standard Version of this Package in any medium without restriction,
            either gratis or for a Distributor Fee, provided that you duplicate
            all of the original copyright notices and associated disclaimers. At
            your discretion, such verbatim copies may or may not include a
            Compiled form of the Package.
          </li>

          <li>
            You may apply any bug fixes, portability changes, and other
            modifications made available from the Copyright Holder. The
            resulting Package will still be considered the Standard Version, and
            as such will be subject to the Original License.

          <p>Distribution of Modified Versions of the Package as Source</p>
          <li>
            You may Distribute your Modified Version as Source (either gratis or
            for a Distributor Fee, and with or without a Compiled form of the
            Modified Version) provided that you clearly document how it differs
            from the Standard Version, including, but not limited to,
            documenting any non-standard features, executables, or modules, and
            provided that you do at least ONE of the following:

            <ol type="a">

                make the Modified Version available to the Copyright Holder of
                the Standard Version, under the Original License, so that the
                Copyright Holder may include your modifications in the Standard
                Version.
              </li>

              <li>
                ensure that installation of your Modified Version does not
                prevent the user installing or running the Standard Version. In
                addition, the Modified Version must bear a name that is
                different from the name of the Standard Version.
              </li>

              <li>
                allow anyone who receives a copy of the Modified Version to make

                    licensing terms that apply to the copy that the licensee
                    received, and requires that the Source form of the Modified
                    Version, and of any works derived from it, be made freely
                    available in that license fees are prohibited but
                    Distributor Fees are allowed.

          <li>
            You may Distribute Compiled forms of the Standard Version without
            the Source, provided that you include complete instructions on how
            to get the Source of the Standard Version. Such instructions must be
            valid at the time of your distribution. If these instructions, at
            any time while you are carrying out such distribution, become
            invalid, you must provide new instructions on demand or cease
            further distribution. If you provide valid instructions or cease
            distribution within thirty days after you become aware that the
            instructions are invalid, then you do not forfeit any of your rights
            under this license.

          <li>
            You may Distribute a Modified Version in Compiled form without the
            Source, provided that you comply with Section 4 with respect to the
            Source of the Modified Version.
          </li>

          <p>Aggregating or Linking the Package</p>
          <li>
            You may aggregate the Package (either the Standard Version or
            Modified Version) with other packages and Distribute the resulting
            aggregation provided that you do not charge a licensing fee for the
            Package. Distributor Fees are permitted, and licensing fees for
            other components in the aggregation are permitted. The terms of this
            license apply to the use and Distribution of the Standard or
            Modified Versions as included in the aggregation.
          </li>

          <li>
            You are permitted to link Modified and Standard Versions with other
            works, to embed the Package in a larger work of your own, or to
            build stand-alone binary or bytecode versions of applications that
            include the Package, and Distribute the result without restriction,
            provided the result does not expose a direct interface to the
            Package.
          </li>

          <p>Items That are Not Considered Part of a Modified Version</p>
          <li>
            Works (including, but not limited to, modules and scripts) that
            merely extend or make use of the Package, do not, by themselves,
            cause the Package to be a Modified Version. In addition, such works
            are not considered parts of the Package itself, and are not subject
            to the terms of this license.
          </li>

          <p>General Provisions</p>
          <li>
            Any use, modification, and distribution of the Standard or Modified
            Versions is governed by this Artistic License. By using, modifying
            or distributing the Package, you accept this license. Do not use,
            modify, or distribute the Package, if you do not accept this
            license.

          <li>
            If your Modified Version has been derived from a Modified Version

            ensure that your Modified Version complies with the requirements of
            this license.

          <li>
            This license does not grant you the right to use any trademark,

            licensable by the Copyright Holder that are necessarily infringed by
            the Package. If you institute patent litigation (including a
            cross-claim or counterclaim) against any party alleging that the
            Package constitutes direct or contributory patent infringement, then
            this Artistic License to you shall terminate on the date that such
            litigation is filed.

          <li>
            There are no restrictions on distributing unmodified copies of Vim
            except that they must include this license text. You can also
            distribute unmodified parts of Vim, likewise unrestricted except
            that they must include this license text. You are also allowed to
            include executables that you made from the unmodified Vim sources,
            plus your own usage examples and Vim scripts.

          <li>
            It is allowed to distribute a modified (or extended) version of Vim,
            including executables and/or source code, when the following four
            conditions are met:
            <ol type="1">
              <li>This license text must be included unmodified.</li>
              <li>
                The modified Vim must be distributed in one of the following
                five ways:
                <ol type="a">
                  <li>
                    If you make changes to Vim yourself, you must clearly
                    describe in the distribution how to contact you. When the
                    maintainer asks you (in any way) for a copy of the modified
                    Vim you distributed, you must make your changes, including
                    source code, available to the maintainer without fee. The
                    maintainer reserves the right to include your changes in the
                    official version of Vim. What the maintainer will do with
                    your changes and under what license they will be distributed
                    is negotiable. If there has been no negotiation then this
                    license, or a later version, also applies to your changes.
                    The current maintainer is Bram Moolenaar
                    <a href="mailto:Bram@vim.org">Bram@vim.org</a>. If this
                    changes it will be announced in appropriate places (most

                    comp.editors). When it is completely impossible to contact
                    the maintainer, the obligation to send him your changes
                    ceases. Once the maintainer has confirmed that he has
                    received your changes they will not have to be sent again.

                    If you have received a modified Vim that was distributed as
                    mentioned under a) you are allowed to further distribute it
                    unmodified, as mentioned at I). If you make additional
                    changes the text under a) applies to those changes.
                  </li>

                  <li>
                    Provide all the changes, including source code, with every
                    copy of the modified Vim you distribute. This may be done in
                    the form of a context diff. You can choose what license to
                    use for new code you add. The changes and their license must
                    not restrict others from making their own changes to the
                    official version of Vim.
                  </li>

                  <li>
                    When you have a modified Vim which includes changes as
                    mentioned under c), you can distribute it without the source
                    code for the changes if the following three conditions are
                    met:
                    <ul>
                      <li>
                        The license that applies to the changes permits you to
                        distribute the changes to the Vim maintainer without fee
                        or restriction, and permits the Vim maintainer to
                        include the changes in the official version of Vim
                        without fee or restriction.

                      <li>
                        You keep the changes for at least three years after last
                        distributing the corresponding modified Vim. When the
                        maintainer or someone who you distributed the modified
                        Vim to asks you (in any way) for the changes within this
                        period, you must make them available to him.

                      <li>
                        You clearly describe in the distribution how to contact
                        you. This contact information must remain valid for at
                        least three years after last distributing the
                        corresponding modified Vim, or as long as possible.

                    When the GNU General Public License (GPL) applies to the
                    changes, you can distribute the modified Vim under the GNU
                    GPL version 2 or any later version.

                A message must be added, at least in the output of the
                ":version" command and in the intro screen, such that the user
                of the modified Vim is able to see that it was modified. When
                distributing as mentioned under 2)e) adding the message is only
                required for as far as this does not conflict with the license
                used for the changes.
              </li>

              <li>
                The contact information as required under 2)a) and 2)d) must not
                be removed or changed, except that the person himself can make
                corrections.

            If you distribute a modified version of Vim, you are encouraged to
            use the Vim license for your changes and make them available to the
            maintainer, including the source code. The preferred way to do this
            is by e-mail or by uploading the files to a server and e-mailing the
            URL. If the number of changes is small (e.g., a modified Makefile)
            e-mailing a context diff will do. The e-mail address to be used is
            <a href="mailto:maintainer@vim.org">maintainer@vim.org</a>
          </li>

          <li>
            It is not allowed to remove this license from the distribution of
            the Vim sources, parts of it or from a modified version. You may use
            this license for previous Vim releases instead of the license that
            they came with, at your option.

                and third party software packages from our extension marketplace
                or package managers. Those packages are under their own

                <strong>Data Collection.</strong>
                The software may collect information about you and your use of
                the software, and send that to Microsoft. Microsoft may use this
                information to provide services and improve our products and
                services. You may opt-out of many of these scenarios, but not
                all, as described in the product documentation located at

                >. There may also be some features in the software that may
                enable you and Microsoft to collect data from users of your
                applications. If you use these features, you must comply with
                applicable law, including providing appropriate notices to users
                of your applications together with Microsoft’s privacy
                statement. Our privacy statement is located at

                <strong>Processing of Personal Data.</strong>
                To the extent Microsoft is a processor or subprocessor of
                personal data in connection with the software, Microsoft makes

          <li>
            <strong>UPDATES.</strong>
            The software may periodically check for updates and download and
            install them for you. You may obtain updates only from Microsoft or
            authorized sources. Microsoft may need to update your system to
            provide you with updates. You agree to receive these automatic
            updates without any additional notice. Updates may not include or
            support all existing software features, services, or peripheral
            devices. If you do not want automatic updates, you may turn them off
            by following the instructions in the documentation at
            <a href="https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=616397"

            <strong>FEEDBACK.</strong>
            If you give feedback about the software to Microsoft, you give to
            Microsoft, without charge, the right to use, share and commercialize
            your feedback in any way and for any purpose. You will not give
            feedback that is subject to a license that requires Microsoft to
            license its software or documentation to third parties because we
            include your feedback in them. These rights survive this agreement.
          </li>

          <li>
            <strong>SCOPE OF LICENSE.</strong>
            This license applies to the Visual Studio Code product. Source code

            under the MIT license agreement. The software is licensed, not sold.
            This agreement only gives you some rights to use the software.
            Microsoft reserves all other rights. Unless applicable law gives you
            more rights despite this limitation, you may use the software only
            as expressly permitted in this agreement. In doing so, you must
            comply with any technical limitations in the software that only
            allow you to use it in certain ways. You may not
            <ul style="list-style-type: disc">
              <li>
                reverse engineer, decompile or disassemble the software, or
                otherwise attempt to derive the source code for the software
                except and solely to the extent required by third party
                licensing terms governing use of certain open source components
                that may be included in the software;

                remove, minimize, block or modify any notices of Microsoft or
                its suppliers in the software;

          </li>

          <li>
            <strong>SUPPORT SERVICES.</strong>
            Because this software is “as is,” we may not provide support
            services for it.
          </li>

          <li>
            <strong>ENTIRE AGREEMENT.</strong>
            This agreement, and the terms for supplements, updates,
            Internet-based services and support services that you use, are the
            entire agreement for the software and support services.
          </li>

          <li>
            <strong>EXPORT RESTRICTIONS.</strong>
            You must comply with all domestic and international export laws and
            regulations that apply to the software, which include restrictions
            on destinations, end-users, and end use. For further information on
            export restrictions, see
            <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/exporting"
              >https://www.microsoft.com/exporting</a
            >.
          </li>

          <li>
            <strong>APPLICABLE LAW.</strong>
            If you acquired the software in the United States, Washington law
            applies to interpretation of and claims for breach of this
            agreement, and the laws of the state where you live apply to all
            other claims. If you acquired the software in any other country, its
            laws apply.
          </li>

          <li>
            <strong>CONSUMER RIGHTS; REGIONAL VARIATIONS.</strong>
            This agreement describes certain legal rights. You may have other
            rights, including consumer rights, under the laws of your state or
            country. Separate and apart from your relationship with Microsoft,
            you may also have rights with respect to the party from which you
            acquired the software. This agreement does not change those other
            rights if the laws of your state or country do not permit it to do
            so. For example, if you acquired the software in one of the below
            regions, or mandatory country law applies, then the following
            provisions apply to you:

            <ol type="a">
              <li>
                <strong>Australia.</strong>
                You have statutory guarantees under the Australian Consumer Law
                and nothing in this agreement is intended to affect those
                rights.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Canada.</strong>
                If you acquired this software in Canada, you may stop receiving
                updates by turning off the automatic update feature,
                disconnecting your device from the Internet (if and when you
                re-connect to the Internet, however, the software will resume
                checking for and installing updates), or uninstalling the
                software. The product documentation, if any, may also specify
                how to turn off updates for your specific device or software.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Germany and Austria.</strong>

                  <li>
                    <strong>Warranty.</strong>
                    The properly licensed software will perform substantially as
                    described in any Microsoft materials that accompany the
                    software. However, Microsoft gives no contractual guarantee
                    in relation to the licensed software.

                  <li>
                    <strong>Limitation of Liability.</strong>
                    In case of intentional conduct, gross negligence, claims
                    based on the Product Liability Act, as well as, in case of
                    death or personal or physical injury, Microsoft is liable
                    according to the statutory law.
                  </li>
                </ol>

                <p>
                  Subject to the foregoing clause (ii), Microsoft will only be
                  liable for slight negligence if Microsoft is in breach of such
                  material contractual obligations, the fulfillment of which
                  facilitate the due performance of this agreement, the breach
                  of which would endanger the purpose of this agreement and the
                  compliance with which a party may constantly trust in
                  (so-called "cardinal obligations"). In other cases of slight
                  negligence, Microsoft will not be liable for slight
                  negligence.
                </p>

              This limitation applies to (a) anything related to the software,
              services, content (including code) on third party Internet sites,
              or third party applications; and (b) claims for breach of
              contract, breach of warranty, guarantee or condition, strict
              liability, negligence, or other tort to the extent permitted by
              applicable law.
            </p>
            <p>
              It also applies even if Microsoft knew or should have known about
              the possibility of the damages. The above limitation or exclusion
              may not apply to you because your state or country may not allow
              the exclusion or limitation of incidental, consequential or other
              damages.
