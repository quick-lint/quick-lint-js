          After your for-hire task is complete <strong>to our liking</strong>,

      </ol>

      <h2>Payment options</h2>
      <ul>

          you)
        </li>
        <li>
          <a href="https://www.paypal.com/us/home">PayPal</a> (United States
          only) (fees paid by you)
        </li>
        <li>
          <a href="https://wise.com/">Wise</a> (international) (exchanged using
          Wise' rates; fees paid by you)
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Terms and conditions</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          "We" refers to <a href="https://github.com/strager">strager</a>.
        </li>
        <li>
          Only tasks labelled <code>for hire</code> on GitHub are eligible for
          claiming and payout.
        </li>
        <li>
          To receive earnings, you must accept our
          <a
            href="https://github.com/quick-lint/quick-lint-js/blob/1bb43f9b87aae77921f0b074ef7ead2fa95f9c96/docs/CLA-v1.md"
            >Contributor License Agreement</a
          >.
        </li>
        <li>
          Earnings are listed in the for-hire task's title. For example, if you
          complete your in-progress for-hire task titled
          <q>7$: ARM/AArch64 build for Apple M1 for hire</q>, you will receive 7
          <abbr title="United states Dollars">USD</abbr> (before currency
          exchange) after completing this task.
        </li>
        <li>
          Earnings (before currency exchange) are decided when the for-hire task
          is claimed.
        </li>
        <li>
          If you do not email us within five days of us assigning a for-hire
          task to you, you will be forcefully removed from that task.
        </li>
        <li>
          If you make little progress within a month on one of your assigned
          for-hire tasks, you will be forcefully removed from that task and
          banned from claiming future for-hire tasks. We decide what is meant by
          little progress.
        </li>
        <li>
          You may have at most one claimed or in-progress for-hire task at a
          time. (You may not have one claimed for-hire task and one in-progress
          for-hire task.)
        </li>
        <li>
          If you are not the assignee of a for-hire task, you will not receive
          earnings.
        </li>
        <li>
          You will only receive earnings after we decide that your for-hire task
          is complete. We decide what completion means for each for-hire task,
          and we reserved the right to, at any time, change what completion
          means. It is your responsibility to ask what completion means for your
          for-hire task.
        </li>
        <li>
          Payment will <strong>not</strong> be sent for partial completion.
        </li>
      </ul>
