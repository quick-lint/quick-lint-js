# E0459: equality check result is unused; did you mean to use assignment (=) instead?

Using `==` as a statement rather than a comparison is almost never intended.

```javascript
let x = 4;
let y = 5;

// set x to y - oops, one = instead of two so no assignment is made!
x == y;
```

To resolve this, either correct to `=` instead:
```javascript
let x = 4;
let y = 5;

x = y; // no error
```

Or use/discard the result:
```javascript
let x = 4;
let y = 5;
function f(_) { }

let _ = x == y;
void (x == y);
f(x == y);
```
