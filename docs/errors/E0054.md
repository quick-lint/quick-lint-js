# E0054: unexpected token

If you get error E0054, quick-lint-js does not understand your code for some
reasons. The authors of quick-lint-js have not written a helpful message.

If you encounter this error, please [submit a bug
report](https://github.com/quick-lint/quick-lint-js/issues).

Typically, this error occurs if code contains an operator which doesn't belong:

    let person = "Sam";:

To fix this error, write correct JavaScript syntax:

    let person = "Sam";
