# E207: code point in Unicode escape sequence must not be greater than U+10FFFF

The following code has escaped code point in Unicode out of
range.

    let x = "hello\u{abcdef}";

To fix this error, make sure that the escaped code point is
between U+0000 and U+10FFFF inclusive.

    let x = "hello\u{abcde}";
