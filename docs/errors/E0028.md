# E0028: number literal contains consecutive underscores

Number literals can contain underscores (`_`) to separate digits for legibility.
At most one `_` can be used between a pair of digits:

    let PIN_LED = 0b0__1;
    const tau = 3.14159____26536 * 2;

To fix this error, remove extraneous underscores:

    let PIN_LED = 0b0_1;
    const tau = 3.14159_26536 * 2;
