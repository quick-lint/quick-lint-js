# E0047: unexpected characters in octal literal

Octal number literals start with `0` or `0o` and can only contain digits `0`
through `7` (and optionally an `n` to signify a `BigInt`). It is an error to
include other digits in octal number literals:

    let permissions = 0o755N;
    let bcdDigits = 0o0123456789;
    let million = 0o1e6;

To fix this error, fix or remove the extra digits or letters:

    let permissions = 0o755n;

Alternatively, convert the octal number literal into a decimal or hexadecimal
number literal:

    let bcdDigits = 123456789;
    let million = 1e6;
