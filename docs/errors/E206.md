# E206: error label named await not allowed in async function

The following code is using label named 'await' in an async
function.

    async function f() {
      await:
    }

To fix this error, rename label await to something else.

    async function f() {
      label:
    }

Another way to fix this error, make 'f' a normal function
rather than an async function.

    function f() {
      await:
    }
