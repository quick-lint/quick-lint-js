# E0088: while loop is missing '(' or ')' around condition

`while` loops have a condition after the `while` keyword. It is a syntax error
to write a condition without either `(` or `)`:

    let name = '';
    while (name === '' {
      name = prompt('What is your name?');
    }

To fix this error, write `(` before the condition or `)` after the condition:

    let name = '';
    while (name === '') {
      name = prompt('What is your name?');
    }
