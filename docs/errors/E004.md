# E004: assignment to const variable before its declaration

You cannot reassign variables declared with `const`, and you cannot reference a
variable declared with `const` above its declaration. The assignment will crash
with a `ReferenceError` if you run the code.

    let timeElapsed = 31;

    let pie = "cooking";
    if (timeElapsed > 30) {
      pi = "cooked";
    }
    const pi = 3.14;

To fix this error, assign to a different variable or declare a new variable with
a different name:

    let timeElapsed = 31;

    let pie = "cooking";
    if (timeElapsed > 30) {
      pie = "cooked";
    }
    const pi = 3.14;
