# E200: break can only be used inside of a loop or switch

The following code has a `break` statement outside of a loop.

    const birds = ["crow", "sparrow", "eagle", "owl", "pigeon"];
    birds.forEach((bird) => {
        if (bird === "eagle") {
            console.log("Eagle is all out of bubblegum. Asses kicked.");
            break;
        }
    });

To fix this error, you can either make sure that the `break` is within the scope of a loop:

    const birds = ["crow", "sparrow", "eagle", "owl", "pigeon"];
    for (const bird of birds) {
        if (bird === "eagle") {
            console.log("Eagle is all out of bubblegum. Asses kicked.");
            break;
        }
        console.log(`A cool bird: ${bird}`);
    }

or you can find another way to achieve your desired effect:

    const birds = ["crow", "sparrow", "eagle", "owl", "pigeon"];
    let assesKicked = false;
    birds.forEach(bird => {
        if (bird === "eagle") {
            assesKicked = true;
        }
    });
    if (assesKicked) {
        console.log("Eagle is all out of bubblegum. Asses kicked.");
    }
