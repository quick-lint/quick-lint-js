# E0084: do-while loop needs parentheses around condition

`do`-`while` loops have a condition after the `while` keyword. It is a syntax
error to write a condition without `(` and `)`:

    let name;
    do {
      name = prompt('What is your name?');
    } while name === '';

To fix this error, write `(` before the condition and `)` after the condition:

    let name;
    do {
      name = prompt('What is your name?');
    } while (name === '');
