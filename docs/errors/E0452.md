# E0452: empty parenthesis after control statement

Leaving parenthesis empty after control statements (`if`, `while`, `switch`,
`with`) is a syntax error.

```javascript
while () {
  console.log("Oops!..")
}
```

If the intention here was to create an infinite loop, the implementation would
be this:

```javascript
while (true) {
  console.log("Now, that's an infinite loop");
}
```
