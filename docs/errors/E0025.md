# E0025: missing comma between object literal entries

Object literal entries, including methods, are separated by commas. It is an
error to write two entries without a comma in between:

```javascript
const snuffles = {
  age: 7
  meow() {
    console.log("ðŸ˜¾")
  }
  eat() {
    console.log("ðŸ˜¸")
  }
}
```

To fix this error, include commas:

```javascript
const snuffles = {
  age: 7,
  meow() {
    console.log("ðŸ˜¾")
  },
  eat() {
    console.log("ðŸ˜¸")
  }
}
```

Introduced in quick-lint-js version 0.2.0.
