# E0208: cannot access private identifier outside class

The following code is accessing a private identifier outside
the class.

```javascript
class C {
  #x = 10;
}

function f(c) {
  c.#x = 20;
}
```

To fix this error, move function `f` as a static member of
class `C` .

```javascript
class C {
  #x = 10;
  static f(c) {
    c.#x = 20;
  }
}
```

Another way to fix this error, remove `#` before variable
`x`.

```javascript
class C {
  x = 10;
}

function f(c) {
  c.x = 20;
}
```
