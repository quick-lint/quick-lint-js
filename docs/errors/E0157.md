# E0157: missing end of array; expected ']'

An array literal requires a list of items surrounded by `[` and `]`. It is a
syntax error to start an array literal with `[` but omit the final `]`:

    let friends = ["Alice";

To fix this error, write `]` at the end of the array literal:

    let friends = ["Alice"];
