# E0719: unexpected 'await' keyword on function declaration

If you meant to define an asynchronous function, you need to explicitly annotate
the function with `async` keyword, not `await`.

```javascript
await function f() {}
```

To fix this warning, simply replace `await` by `async`. Now, you have an
asynchronous function and you're able to use `await` inside it.

```javascript
async function f() {}
```
