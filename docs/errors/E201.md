# E201: continue can only be used inside of a loop

The following code has a `continue` statement outside of a loop.

    const birds = ["crow", "sparrow", "eagle", "owl", "pigeon"];
    birds.forEach((bird) => {
        if (bird === "pigeon") {
            continue;
        }
        console.log(`A cool bird: ${bird}`);
    });

To fix this error, you can either make sure that the `continue` is within the scope of a loop:

    const birds = ["crow", "sparrow", "eagle", "owl", "pigeon"];
    for (const bird of birds) {
        if (bird === "pigeon") {
            continue;
        }
        console.log(`A cool bird: ${bird}`);
    }

or you can find another way to move to the next step of your iteration:

    const birds = ["crow", "sparrow", "eagle", "owl", "pigeon"];
    birds.forEach(bird => {
        if (bird !== "pigeon") {
            console.log(`A cool bird: ${bird}`);
        }
    });
