# E201: continue can only be used inside of a loop

The following code has a `continue` statement outside of a loop.
    const bird = "owl";
    if (bird === "pigeon") {
        continue;
    }

To fix this error, make sure that the `continue` is within the scope of a loop.

    const birds = ["crow", "sparrow", "eagle", "owl", "pigeon"];
    for (const bird of birds) {
        if (bird === "pigeon") {
            continue;
        }
        console.log(`A cool bird: ${bird}`);
    }
