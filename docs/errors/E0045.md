# E0045: unexpected control character

JavaScript treats some Unicode control characters, such as newlines, tabs, and
form feeds, as whitespace. Most other control characters are now allowed outside
string literals and template literals:

```javascript
 
```

To fix this error, delete the extra control characters, or put them inside a
comment:

```javascript
/*
 
*/
```

Introduced in quick-lint-js version 0.2.0.
