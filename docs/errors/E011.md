# E011: character is not allowed in identifiers

A function or variable name includes a Unicode escape sequence, and the escape sequence
refers to a character which isn't allowed in a function or variable name:

    let guitar\u2604 = "\uD83C\uDFB8";
    let handc\uffed = true;

To fix this error, use the code point of a Unicode character which is allowed,
or remove the extraneous backslash from the name:

    let guitar\u3604 = "\uD83C\uDFB8";
    let handcuffed = true;

The initial character in a function or variable name can be any of the
following:

* *ID_Start*
* `$`
* `_`

Characters after the initial character in a function or variable name can be
any of the following:

* *ID_Continue*
* `$`
* ZWJ (U+200D)
* ZWNJ (U+200C)
