# E0048: unexpected characters in hex literal

Hexadecimal (hex) number literals start with `0x` and can only contain digits
`0` through `9` and `a` through `f` (and optionally an `n` to signify a
`BigInt`). It is an error to include other letters in hex number literals:

```javascript
let hungry = 0xfeedme;
```

To fix this error, fix or remove the extra digits or letters:

```javascript
let hungry = 0xfeedad00d;
```

Introduced in quick-lint-js version 0.2.0.
