# E0048: unexpected characters in hex literal

Hexadecimal (hex) number literals start with `0x` and can only contain digits
`0` through `9` and `a` through `f` (and optionally an `n` to signify a
`BigInt`). It is an error to include other letters in hex number literals:

    let hungry = 0xfeedme;

To fix this error, fix or remove the extra digits or letters:

    let hungry = 0xfeedad00d;
