# E0711: missing expression in placeholder within template literal

Everytime you use `${}` within a template literal, which is a string defined
with backticks, such as this one below, you should specify an expression
inside its curly braces.

```javascript
const myString = `Here is a string defined with backticks`;
```

See an example:

```javascript
console.log(`My name is ${}`); // error: missing expression in placeholder within template literal
```

Here is how you can solve it:

```javascript
const yourName = "Ryan";
console.log(`My name is ${yourName}`); // Correct
```
