# E0711: missing expression in placeholder within template literal

Everytime you use `${}` within a template literal, which is a string defined
with backticks, such as this one below:

```javascript
`Here is a string defined with backticks`;
```

You should specify a value inside `${}`.

```javascript
const yourName = "Ryan";
console.log(`My name is ${}`); // error: missing expression in placeholder within template literal
```

Here is how you can solve it:

```javascript
const yourName = "Ryan";
console.log(`My name is ${yourName}`); // Correct
```
