# E0721: typeof comparison with invalid string literal

The `typeof` operator will always return a string that can take a value from `["undefined", "object", "boolean", "number", "bigint", "string", "symbol", "function"]`. Therefore, comparing to another sting has a high chance of being an error
([MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/typeof))

```javascript
let x = foo;
if (typeof x === "strng") {
    // this will not run!
    alert("x is a string!");
}
```
Instead, compare against the string `"string"`;

```javascript
let x = "foo"
if (typeof x === "string") {
    // this will run now :)
    alert("x is a string");
}
```
