# E0049: binary number literal has no digits

Decimal number literals start with `0b` and require at least one digit. It is an
error to write `0b` with no following digits:

    let mask = 0b

To fix this error, write digits after `0b`:

    let mask = 0b1000;

Alternatively, remove `b` to create a `0` number literal.
