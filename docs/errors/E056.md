# E056: unmatched parenthesis

It is an error to write the `(` without its matching `)`:

    function fma(a, b, c) {
      return (a * b + c;
    }
    let five = (fma(2, 2, 1);

To fix this error, write the closing `)`, or remove the extraneous `(`:

    function fma(a, b, c) {
      return (a * b) + c;
    }
    let five = fma(2, 2, 1);
