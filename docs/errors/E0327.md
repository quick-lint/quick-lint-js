# E0327: 'function async f()' is not allowed; write 'async function f()' instead

Class methods can have modifiers such as `export`, `static`, `async`, and `*`. It is a
syntax error to write `function async f()` in a function declaration because async will
not be recognized as a keyword but as the function name:

```javascript
function async f() {
  return 0;
}
```

To fix this error, replace `function async` with `async function`:

```javascript
async function f() {
  return 0;
}
```

Introduced in quick-lint-js version 3.0.0.
