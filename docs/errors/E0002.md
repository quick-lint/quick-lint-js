# E0002: assignment to const global variable

`Infinity`, `NaN`, and `undefined` are global variables which cannot be changed.
Assignments to these variables are silently ignored.

```javascript
NaN = 0;
undefined = null;
```

To fix this error, pick a different variable to assign to.

Introduced in quick-lint-js version 0.2.0.
