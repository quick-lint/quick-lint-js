# E0022: invalid UTF-8 sequence

<!-- QLJS_NO_CHECK_CODE -->

JavaScript files are normally encoded using UTF-8. It is an error for a
UTF-8 JavaScript file to contain bytes which are not valid UTF-8.

quick-lint-js only supports UTF-8 JavaScript files. UTF-16, ISO-8859-1, and
other encodings are not supported by quick-lint-js. Save your file as UTF-8 to
check it with quick-lint-js.

Introduced in quick-lint-js version 0.2.0.
