# E0292: character is not allowed in global identifiers

Certain characters generate errors when used in JSON global variables in config files, such as the ```.``` below.

```example-invalid-period
{
  "globals": {
    "jest.": true
  }
}
```

Leading spaces and numbers are also disallowed:

```example-invalid-nums
{ 
  "globals": { 
    "123ABC": true 
  } 
}
```

As are certain unicode characters:

```example-invalid-unicode
{ 
  "globals": { 
    "\u2604": true 
  } 
}
```

To fix this error, rename variables to exclude disallowed characters and leading numbers or spaces.
