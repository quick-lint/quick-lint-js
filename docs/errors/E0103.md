# E0103: missing 'while (condition)' for do-while statement

A `do`-`while` loop has three parts: the `do` keyword, a body (a statement, or a
list of statements surrounded by `{` and `}`), and the `while` part including
the condition. It is a syntax error to write the `do` keyword without the
`while` part:

    let name;
    do {
      name = prompt('What is your name?');
    };
    while (name === '');

To fix this error, make sure there is nothing between the loop's body and the
`while` keyword:

    let name;
    do {
      name = prompt('What is your name?');
    }
    while (name === '');
