# E0203: depth limit exceeded

<!-- QLJS_NO_CHECK_CODE -->

JavaScript code can contain nested functions, arrays, objects, classes, etc.
quick-lint-js only supports nesting up to a limit. Most code shouldn't hit this
limit. If you do hit this limit, refactor your code to reduce nesting.

Introduced in quick-lint-js version 0.3.0.
