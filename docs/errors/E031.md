# E031: octal literal may not have decimal

Decimal number literals can contain a decimal (fraction). Octal number literals,
which start with an extra `0` digit, cannot contain a decimal:

    const PI = 03.14;

To fix this error, make the number literal a decimal number literal by removing
the extra leading `0`:

    const PI = 3.14;
