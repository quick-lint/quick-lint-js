# E0014: expected expression before newline

`throw` statements cannot have a newline between the `throw` keyword and the
thrown expression:

    throw
      new Error(
        "something terrible happened!"
      );

To fix this error, add parentheses:

    throw (
      new Error(
        "something terrible happened!"
      )
    );

Alternatively, start the expression on the same line as the `throw` keyword:

    throw new Error(
      "something terrible happened!"
    );
