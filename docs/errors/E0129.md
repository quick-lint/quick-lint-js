# E0129: expected 'from "name_of_module.mjs"'

`import` statements load things from other files. It is a syntax error to omit
the name of the module being imported:

    import React, {createElement};

To fix this error, write the `from` keyword followed by the module name:

    import React, {createElement} from 'react';
