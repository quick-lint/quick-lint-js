# E085: do-while loop is missing '(' or ')' around condition

`do`-`while` loops have a condition after the `while` keyword. It is a syntax
error to write a condition without either `(` or `)`:

    let name;
    do {
      name = prompt('What is your name?');
    } while (name === '';

To fix this error, write `(` before the condition or `)` after the condition:

    let name;
    do {
      name = prompt('What is your name?');
    } while (name === '');
