# E0373: Pointless Comparison Against String Literal

A condition with a string literal will always evaluate to true

```typescript
if("x" || "y"){
    let x = y;
}
```

To fix this warning, remove the condition.

```typescript
let x = y;
```

Or, 

```typescript
case "x" || "y":
```

To fix this warning, make separate cases

```typescript
case "x":

case "y":
```
