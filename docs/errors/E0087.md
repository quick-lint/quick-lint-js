# E0087: while loop needs parentheses around condition

`while` loops have a condition after the `while` keyword. It is a syntax error
to write a condition without `(` and `)`:

    let name = '';
    while name === '' {
      name = prompt('What is your name?');
    }

To fix this error, write `(` before the condition and `)` after the condition:

    let name = '';
    while (name === '') {
      name = prompt('What is your name?');
    }
