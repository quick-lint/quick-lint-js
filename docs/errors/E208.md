# E208: cannot access private identifier outside class

The following code is accessing a private identifier outside
the class.

    class C {
        #x = 10;
    }

    function f(c) {
      c.#x = 20;
    }

To fix this error, move function `f` as a static member of
class `C` .

    class C {
        #x = 10;
        static f(c) {
          c.#x = 20;
        }
    }

Another way to fix this error, remove `#` before variable
`x`.

    class C {
        x = 10;
    }

    function f(c) {
      c.x = 20;
    }
