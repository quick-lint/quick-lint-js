# E208: cannot access private identifier outside class

The following code is accessing a private identifier outside
the class.

    class C {
        #x = 10;
    }

    function f() {
      this.#x = 20;
    }

To fix this error, move function `f` as a member of class `C`.

    class C {
        #x = 10;
        f() {
          this.#x = 20;
        }
    }

Another way to fix this error, remove `#` before variable
`x`.

    class C {
        #x = 10;
    }

    function f() {
      this.x = 20;
    }
