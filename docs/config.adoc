== Name

quick-lint-js.config - configuration file for *quick-lint-js*(1)

== Synopsis

`quick-lint-js.config`

endif::backend-manpage[]

== Description

The
ifdef::backend-manpage[]
*quick-lint-js*(1) program,
endif::[]
ifdef::backend-html5[]
link:../cli/[quick-lint-js CLI],
endif::[]
ifndef::backend-html5,backend-manpage[]
quick-lint-js CLI,
endif::[]
and also quick-lint-js editor plugins, can be configured using a `quick-lint-js.config` file.

== Files

quick-lint-js uses the following algorithm to find its configuration:

1. If the input JavaScript file has no path (e.g. if its contents are given using standard input (*--stdin*) and the *--path-for-config-search* option is not used), assume no configuration file and stop.
2. Compute the absolute canonical path of the input JavaScript file by joining the JavaScript file's given path with the current working directory, following all symbolic links, and resolving all `.` and `..` components.
   (If the *--path-for-config-search* option was used, compute its absolute canonical path.)
3. Check if the absolute canonical path computed in step 2 exists.
   a. If the path exists, remove the last component of the path.
      Remember this path as the _current directory_.
   b. If the path does not exist, remove the last component of the path repeatedly until the path exists.
      If no checked path exists (for example, if a path with a non-existent drive was given), assume no configuration file and stop.
      Remember this path as the _current directory_.
4. Look for a configuration file in the _current directory_:
   a. Check if the file `quick-lint-js.config` exists.
      If so, use it as the configuration file and stop.
   b. Go to step 5.
5. If the _current directory_ is a filesystem root, assume no configuration file and stop.
6. Remove the last component of the _current directory_.
7. Go to step 4.

In short, quick-lint-js looks for `quick-lint-js.config` in ancestor directories.

If no configuration file is found, quick-lint-js behaves as if a `quick-lint-js.config` file was found with contents `{}`.

In addition to the above search algorithm, the
ifdef::backend-html5[]
link:../cli/#config-file[*--config-file* command-line option]
endif::[]
ifndef::backend-html5[]
*--config-file* command-line option
endif::[]
can be given to
ifdef::backend-manpage[]
*quick-lint-js*(1).
endif::[]
ifndef::backend-manpage[]
quick-lint-js' CLI.
endif::[]

== Format

`quick-lint-js.config` files contain UTF-8-encoded JSON (per RFC 8259).
The top-level object contains quick-lint-js configuration properties.
A `quick-lint-js.config` file with no configuration looks like this:

[source,json]
----
{}
----

`quick-lint-js.config` do not support a dedicated comment syntax.

== Options

The quick-lint-js configuration object can contain one or more of the following keys:

*globals*:: Optional.
Global variables which programs can use.
+
*globals* is an object.
Its format is described in the <<Globals>> section below.

*global-groups*:: Optional.
Pre-defined categories of global variables which programs can use.
+
--
*global-groups* is either an array or a boolean.

If *global-groups* is *true* or not present, then it's as if the value was an array of all possible group names, except for *literally-anything*.

If *global-groups* is *false* or an empty array, then no global variables are defined aside from those listed in the *globals* configuration property.

If *global-groups* is a non-empty array, then global variables are defined per the given group names.
Each group name is a string.
For the list of group names, see the <<Global Groups>> section.
--

[#globals]
== Globals

The *globals* configuration property tells quick-lint-js what global variables to assume exist.

If the global variables you want are from a popular platform or library, you might want to use *global-groups* instead.

Each property in the *globals* configuration property represents a single global variable.
The property's key is the JavaScript variable name.
The property's value can be either *true*, *false*, or an object:

- If the value is *true*, then the variable is defined as if the property's value was *{}*.
- If the value is *false*, then the variable is not defined, even if a group listed in *global-groups* would otherwise define the variable.
- If the value is an object, then the variable is defined with attributes according to the object:
+
--
- *shadowable*: Optional.
  If *true* or not present, the variable can redefined in the program's outer-most scope.
  If *false*, the variable cannot be redefined in the program's outer-most scope.
- *writable*: Optional.
  If *true* or not present, the variable can be assigned to.
  If *false*, the variable cannot be assigned to.
--

JSON Unicode escapes (*"\u0068ello"*) are allowed in the variable name.
JavaScript Unicode escapes (*"\\u{68}llo"*) are not allowed in the variable name.

[#global-groups]
== Global Groups

The following groups are supported for the *global-groups* configuration property:

*literally-anything*:: all possible global variables.
All global variables are defined as shadowable and writable.
This in effect suppresses E0002, E0033, E0057, or E0059 entirely (except if variables are also configured using the *globals* configuration property).
This group is not enabled by default.
*browser*:: globals defined in HTML and DOM standards, including *window*, *alert*, and *console*.
This group is enabled by default.
*ecmascript*:: globals defined by the latest ECMAScript (JavaScript) standard, including *Object* and *NaN*.
This group is enabled by default.
*jasmine*:: globals defined by the Jasmine test framework, including *describe*, *it*, and *expect*.
This group is enabled by default.
*jest*:: globals defined by the Jest test framework, including *describe*, *test*, and *expect*.
This group is enabled by default.
*jquery*:: globals defined by the jQuery library, including *$*.
This group is enabled by default.
*node.js*:: globals defined by Node.js for CommonJS modules, including *require*, *console*, and *__dirname*.
This group is enabled by default.
*node.js-es*:: globals defined by Node.js for ES modules, including *console* and *process*.
This group is enabled by default.

== Examples

Imagine we have a browser-only application.
Its tests are written using the Jest testing framework.
It uses the Google Maps libraries, which are exposed using the *google* global variable.
Such an application might have the following `quick-lint-js.config` file:

[source,json]
----
{
  "global-groups": ["browser", "ecmascript", "jest"],
  "globals": {
    "google": {"writable": false}
  }
}
----

'''

If you want to suppress E0002, E0033, E0057, or E0059, configure *globals* or *global-groups*.
For example, if you're seeing a spurious warning E0057 "use of undeclared variable: MyLibrary" (false positive), use the following configuration in `quick-lint-js.config`:

[source,json]
----
{
  "globals": {
    "MyLibrary": true
  }
}
----

If you are not seeing E0002, E0033, E0057, or E0059 (false negative), but you want to see E0057 "use of undeclared variable: $", use one of the following configuration in `quick-lint-js.config`:

[source,json]
----
{
  "globals": {
    "$": false
  }
}
----

Alternatively, suppress the *jquery* globals group (which defines *$* as a global variable) by enabling only the environments you use in your project with this `quick-lint-js.config`:

[source,json]
----
{
  "global-groups": ["ecmascript", "node.js"]
}
----
