# Release notes

This document chronicles quick-lint-js' releases. This document's format is
based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/).

quick-lint-js' version numbers are arbitrary. quick-lint-js does *not* adhere to
Semantic Versioning.

## Unreleased

Beta release.

### Security

* Vim plugin: Version 0.2.0 executed `node_modules/.bin/quick-lint-js` without
  validating that the program is really quick-lint-js. The plugin now
  conservatively ignores `quick-lint-js` in `node_modules` by default.

### Added

* New JS syntax: `.?`, class fields, `import.meta`, top-level `await`,
  `#privateProperties`
* Translations: Swedish (implemented by [Kim "Linden"][])
* Emacs plugin (implemented by [wagner riffel][])
* Neovim plugin
* Global variables can be configured using a `quick-lint-js.config` file
* Errors and warnings are now documented on the website
* Various new errors and error message improvements (implemented by
  [AidenThing][], [Erlliam Mejia][], [Himanshu][], [Lee Wannacott][], [Matheus
  Sousa][])
* Shell completion for the CLI (Bash, Fish, Zsh) (implemented by [Shivam
  Mehta][])
* `--stdin` CLI option allows reading JavaScript from standard input instead of
  a file (implemented by [wagner riffel][])

### Fixed

* `with` statements and `eval` no longer cause spurious undeclared variable
  warnings (implemented by [Himanshu][])
* `++a[0];` no longer reports an assignment-to-const-variable error if `a` was
  declared with `const` (implemented by [Himanshu][])
* `'undefined' === typeof foo ? 3 : 4` no longer reports a warning that `foo` is
  undeclared (implemented by [Himanshu][])
* Building tests with GCC 11.1.1 no longer fails due to `-Werror`
* Various crashes given invalid JavaScript no longer happen
* Building the VS Code plugin now works on Windows (implemented by [Jimmy
  Qiu][])
