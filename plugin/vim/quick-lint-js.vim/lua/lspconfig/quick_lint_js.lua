-- HACK(strager): Since nvim-lspconfig commit 97da7ed12e [1] (November 25,
-- 2021), we must register with the module named "lspconfig.configs". Prior to
-- that commit, we must register with the module named "lspconfig/configs". This
-- is a breaking change in nvim-lspconfig [2].
--
-- There doesn't seem to be a way to detect whether we're on the old version or
-- the new version of nvim-lspconfig [3]. Register our config under both module
-- names. (require() succeeds with both module names both before and after the
-- breaking change.)
